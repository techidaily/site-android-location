Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Asus  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Asus-ROG-Phone-7" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Asus ROG Phone 7"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Asus ROG Phone 7</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Asus  phone.

In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Asus"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Asus ROG Phone 7 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Asus , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Asus </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902278/19272" target="_top" id="1902278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902278/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Asus  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Ideally, you should look for these parameters while downloading any fake location spoofer.</p><ul><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This is the first thing that you should check for any fake GPS app. It should be compatible with your phone and the other streaming, dating, or gaming app on which you wish to change your location.</li><li><strong>Developer background:</strong> There are so many fake location spoofer apps on the Play Store. The best way to filter them is by looking at the developer. That is, it should be from a trusted and reliable source.</li><li><strong>User rating:</strong> This is ideally the direct parameter for judging any app. The higher its rating, the better the app would be.</li><li><strong>User feedback:</strong> Apart from the app rating, you should also read the comments of other users. This will let you know their experience of using the location spoofer app.</li><li><strong>Last update:</strong> Ideally, the fake GPS spoofer app should be updated regularly.

Also, it should not need any modification or root access on the Asus ROG Phone 7 device.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android"></a>Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android</h2><p>Without much ado, let’s get to know about some of the best fake location spoofer apps that you can use for free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977006">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977006">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977006%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977006/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa"><a href="#Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="Fake GPS Location by Lexa"></a>Fake GPS Location by Lexa</h3><p>If you are looking for a reliable and lightweight fake GPS location spoofer free app, then give this one a go.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your ZTE Axon 40 Lite Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your ZTE Axon 40 Lite Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Vivo , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Vivo </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dive-Into-the-World-of-High-Performance-Gadgets-at-Your-Site-Name-–-Your-Ultimate-Tech-Guide"><a href="#Dive-Into-the-World-of-High-Performance-Gadgets-at-Your-Site-Name-–-Your-Ultimate-Tech-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Dive Into the World of High-Performance Gadgets at [Your Site Name] – Your Ultimate Tech Guide"></a>Dive Into the World of High-Performance Gadgets at [Your Site Name] – Your Ultimate Tech Guide</h2><p>This year’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" >Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> trade show was filled interesting AI focused PCs, but often, their most interesting features had little to do with AI. Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one. The screen supports ten-point touch so you can pinch-to-zoom or even finger paint on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Of course, MSI, like every other PC OEM, feels compelled to tout the computer’s AI features and how they integrate with the screen. The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat. If you have an RTX card, try<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI" >ComfyUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a very powerful frontend for Stable Diffusion.</p><p> What you can’t get elsewhere is a full HD screen that takes up the entire front surface of your chassis. We have seen some cases with screens on the front – the<a class="link"   href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/D41MESHSCREENBlack.html" >Jonsbo D41 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes to mind. But MSI’s display takes up the entire space and is meant to be an integral part of the user experience, not just a cute special effect.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-prelude-to-cinematic-dialogue/"><u>[New] Prelude to Cinematic Dialogue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-top-12-html5-videophones-for-optimal-viewing/"><u>[New] Top 12 HTML5 Videophones for Optimal Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-guide-to-seamlessly-share-your-igtv-story/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Guide to Seamlessly Share Your IGTV Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-samsung-galaxy-m14-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-free-location-spoofers-to-fake-gps-location-on-your-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Free Location Spoofers to Fake GPS Location on your Honor 90 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/best-footage-makers-the-top-10-cameras-with-anti-shake-tech-for-2024/"><u>Best Footage Makers The Top 10 Cameras With Anti-Shake Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/ensuring-safe-ai-growth-the-openai-executive-stance/"><u>Ensuring Safe AI Growth - The OpenAI Executive Stance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Motorola Moto G24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-ways-to-manage-your-tecno-camon-20-premier-5g-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Easy Ways to Manage Your Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G Location Settings | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/nintendo-switch-improved-with-an-additional-remote-player/"><u>Nintendo Switch Improved with an Additional Remote Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/techniques-for-fabulous-photo-collage-artistry/"><u>Techniques for Fabulous Photo Collage Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/upgrade-screen-drivers-in-windows-10-acer-model/"><u>Upgrade Screen Drivers in Windows 10, Acer Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/utilizing-mentions-as-a-litmus-test-for-authentic-bots/"><u>Utilizing Mentions as a Litmus Test for Authentic Bots</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5"><a href="#How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5" class="headerlink" title="How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5"></a>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</h2><p>Almost all Android phones feature an application that allows third-party apps to track your exact GPS location. However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3.

NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>.

So let’s get started on how you can manage your Honor 90 Lite location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Honor 90 Lite device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2. ExpressVPN"></a>2. ExpressVPN</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg"                      alt="how to fake location by expressvpn"                ></p><p>ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Xiaomi  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Xiaomi  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Redmi K70E"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Redmi K70E</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi Redmi K70E device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151864/7443" target="_top" id="2151864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Vivo  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions.

A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Vivo  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-V27e"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-V27e" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Vivo V27e"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Vivo V27e</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Vivo  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Vivo V27e device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Vivo ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Vivo  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Vivo  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Vivo"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Vivo V27e device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Vivo , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Vivo </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Samsung  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Samsung  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Samsung ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Samsung  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Samsung  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Samsung"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Samsung , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Samsung </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Samsung  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Honor X50 GT device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Honor X50 GT Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Honor X50 GT Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934292/19272" target="_top" id="1934292">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934292" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934292/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Xiaomi 14 Pro location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Xiaomi 14 Pro location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android.

You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi 14 Pro device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services.
