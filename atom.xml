Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!--

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a fairly barebones unpowered antenna that utilizes the same paper-thin rectangular design that can be found on some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market. This design comes with its share of pros (easy setup, not too much clutter) and cons (limited performance, can’t stand on its own).</p><p> Mohu might not be breaking new ground with this antenna, but it’s more than sufficient for most city dwellers and perhaps even a few buyers in the suburbs with a relatively unobstructed path to the broadcast source.</p><h2 id="Design-Basic-but-effective"><a href="#Design-Basic-but-effective" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic but effective"></a><strong>Design: Basic but effective</strong></h2><p> You can find a dozen identical versions of this unpowered antenna by doing a quick search for TV antennas online, and not for no reason. It’s a very uncomplicated design, doesn’t take up too much space, and doesn’t have a lot of points of failure. The 9x11.5-inch rectangular antenna surface is thin, pliable, and features two small punch-holes towards the top which can be used to pin the antenna to an appropriate surface.</p><p> The matte surface is white on one side and black on the other, which could be useful for helping blend the device in with your surroundings. The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is neither the thickest or the thinnest version of this design that we’ve seen. Some are closer to paper thin and extremely flexible, and others were more rigid. If you need to be able to bend the antenna quite a bit to fit it where you need to, this might not be the right one for you.</p><h2 id="Setup-Dead-simple"><a href="#Setup-Dead-simple" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Dead simple"></a><strong>Setup: Dead simple</strong></h2><p> Setup of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is as easy as it gets with antennas. Since there is no external power to connect, you only need to worry about connecting the included coaxial cable to the device and to your TV and using the included pins or adhesive tabs to affix the device to a surface. Ease of setup is one of the benefits of a non-amplified antenna such as the Mohu Leaf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-spreadsheet-free-excel-editor-online-offline-1x.93e269d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible"><a href="#Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Acceptable but not incredible"></a><strong>Performance: Acceptable but not incredible</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna wasn’t the highest performing antenna that I tested, even among similar unpowered antennas. In my channel acquisition test, the Leaf picked up 56 channels on average across all the iterations performed.</p><p> My apartment is located within city limits and doesn’t provide too much of a challenge for antennas, but I was able to reliably get as many as 76 channels from other devices. Nonetheless, the Leaf still provided a clear picture of all the major network stations without any issue. The only channels that I couldn’t pick up with the Leaf were pretty obscure, such as an audio-only station from a Korean Christian church.

This is about what I would expect from an unpowered antenna.

The price definitely feels appropriate for the performance and feature set, but it’s not an all-out bargain.</p><p> Buyers probably wouldn’t be wise to spend more money unless they live a bit further from their signal source and have had trouble with similar antennas in the past. I think that for most people living in cities, the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna should be more than enough.</p><h2 id="Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna"></a><strong>Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Mohu also makes the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mohu-blade-tv-antenna-review-4843106" >Mohu Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a powered antenna with a slightly more unique design for a minor premium of $40. This antenna managed to reliably acquire an average of 69 channels in my tests, a big leap from the performance of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna. That having been said, the Blade does require a power source, and installation is slightly more cumbersome than that of the Leaf. If I wasn’t having any trouble getting the channels I watch with the Leaf, I probably wouldn’t upgrade to the Blade personally.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>No fuss, good value.</strong><br> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a great entry point into the TV antenna space, providing a nice mix of performance and value in a dead-simple package that won’t burden buyers during setup. It might not be powerful enough to suit the needs of suburban users and beyond, but if you’re close enough to the signal source, it’s a nice option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BPDF%2BUnlocker"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/pdf-unlocker.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers. However, outside in the backyard, the speed reduced to 111 Mbps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-display-screen"><a href="#Key-Features-A-display-screen" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A display screen"></a><strong>Key Features: A display screen</strong></h2><p> The touchscreen on the front of the main router can display the time, total GB, WAN and Router IP addresses, internet speeds, and port statuses.

The package I tested, which came with the router and two mesh points, retails for $340. You can find mesh systems for much less, and of course, some mesh systems are much more expensive. But, the Amplifi system’s design, easy setup, and feature set help justify the price.</p><h2 id="Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> A Nest Wi-Fi package sells for around the same price as the Amplifi system. However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points. The Nest system points also serve as Google Assistant speakers, and the system features some more advanced technologies (like WPA3 encryption). However, one big issue with the Nest system is that it only has two Ethernet ports, while the Amplifi router has four spare ports.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Looks better than it performs.</strong></p><p> The Amplifi HD mesh system is attractive and does provide coverage for a huge area, but it doesn’t deliver lightning-fast speeds in a home with dozens of connected

This addition addresses one of the RAX120’s most significant flaws—the absence of cyber security and anti-malware software.</p><p> <em>We purchased the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it.

I tested the Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 to see how well it performs in the real world.</p><h2 id="Design-Batman’s-router"><a href="#Design-Batman’s-router" class="headerlink" title="Design: Batman’s router"></a><strong>Design: Batman’s router</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk RAX120 has a futuristic design—angular, with clean lines. It looks like a cross between a spaceship and the Batmobile. It’s matte black and rectangular, but instead of the multiple antennas you’d typically see protruding from the top of a Nighthawk router, it has two wing-like extensions that come from each side.</p><p> The eight antennas are housed inside of the two wings, so they’re not visible. The antennas are supposed to be ideally pre-positioned for you to get the best possible connection. However, because the eight individual antennas are housed within the wings, you can’t adjust them to your liking. The wings are on hinges though, so can fold down the wings to store the router, as the unit is somewhat large and bulky. It weighs three pounds, and it measures about a foot wide and almost eight inches in depth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fw0FJuD9bAOkQEHuAZ9OFq5toXk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_05-2a03227466354aad82fe55b884b76ac6-4d18f476974a44b081aafc943a8e56b1.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk app walks you through the setup process. There’s a QR code sticker on the router, as well as a temporary network name and password on the label, which allow you to connect quickly and easily.</p><p> The app guides you through creating separate 2.4 and 5GHz networks, but you can also take advantage of a feature called smart connect, which combines your networks and designates your devices based on optimal performance. You can create a guest network, as well as manage and monitor your devices individually. The initial setup process took me about ten minutes in total.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Superfast-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Superfast-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Superfast speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Superfast speeds</strong></h2><p> The RAX120 is a workhorse. It’s classified as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but there’s also a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >tri-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version available (the RAX200). The RAX120 supports 802.11ax, which is also known as Wi-Fi 6. Although Wi-Fi 6 is still relatively new, the addition of Wi-Fi 6 future-proofs the RAX120 to a certain degree. It allows for faster speeds, better battery life on your Wi-Fi 6 compatible and IoT devices, and less congestion on your network.</p><p> With the addition of 802.11ax, the RAX120 also supports 8-stream MU-MIMO, which means your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >wireless router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can communicate with several streaming devices at the same time without experiencing too much congestion. Support for beamforming and Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) also promotes better performance. The RAX120 is backwards compatible with 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac as well, so it’ll work with virtually all of your devices, Wi-Fi 6 or not.</p><p> The RAX120 has four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back (two of which can be combined to support a larger file transfer rate of 2 GB) and a multigig Ethernet port that supports speeds up to 5 gigs. I was impressed overall with the location and specifications of the ports, but I would have liked to see more Ethernet ports on a router this expensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/y2V4Ncx3Z1ul8B-4lsc_IeiyCRQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetGear_LongRangeRouters_Nighthawk_RAX120_04-9e452ddedd2b4a46893fddd147c06d4f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX12"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-performance-Stellar"><a href="#Network-performance-Stellar" class="headerlink" title="Network performance: Stellar"></a><strong>Network performance: Stellar</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk RAX120 indicates top speeds of 1,200 Mbps on the 2.4Ghz band and 4,800 Mbps on the 5Ghz band. My Internet speed maxes out at 500 Mbps. I have about 50 connected devices, more than half of which are smart home devices like smart light switches, smart appliances, security cameras, and smart speakers and displays. The RAX120 had no problem managing my numerous smart devices, nor did I experience any lag or connectivity issues on streaming and gaming devices. I simultaneously ran a gaming computer, two playstations, and two FireTVs without the connection missing a beat.</p><p> I used the smart connect feature when testing the router’s speeds, and it did a decent job of moving me to the appropriate band as I traveled throughout my home. On an 802.11ax compatible iPhone, the Nighthawk RAX120 clocked speeds of 469 Mbps while in the same room as the router. Proximity to the router had little impact in Wi-Fi speeds, as the speeds only dropped slightly (to 455 Mbps) when I traveled to the opposite end of my 1,600 square foot home. When I went out to the backyard, however, the speeds dropped more dramatically (to 385 Mbps).</p><p> On my laptop, which is not Wi-Fi 6 compatible, the speed maxed out at 410 Mbps, and I saw a substantial drop in the backyard (to 280 Mbps), just as I saw with the phone. The router has an impressive range overall, and I didn’t experience any dead zones, which has been a problem with other routers in the past. The speeds on the RAX120 did slow down when faced with obstructions though, especially outdoor walls and appliances.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> The RAX120 is backward compatible with 802.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac as well, so it’ll work with virtually all of your devices, Wi-Fi 6 or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-Quality-hardware-lacks-antivirus"><a href="#Key-Features-Quality-hardware-lacks-antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: Quality hardware, lacks antivirus"></a><strong>Key Features: Quality hardware, lacks antivirus</strong></h2><p> Under the hood, the Nighthawk RAX120 has a 64-bit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/multiple-core-processors-832453" >Quad-core <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.2GHz processor. The quality hardware helps ensure stable and reliable performance. The router has two USB 3.0 storage ports on the back for connecting an external hard drive.</p><p> For security, the RAX120 features WPA3 support, the ability to connect through a VPN, automatic firmware updates, and the ability to create a guest network. The RAX120 does not, however, support Netgear Armor cyber security software. It would have been nice to have the option to include some sort of software for network protection against malware.</p><p> You can enable parental controls on the router. The options are somewhat basic, but they do provide some peace of mind, and they are helpful when paired with other parental control applications.</p><p> The RAX120 is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can use voice commands and say things like, “Alexa, ask NETGEAR to enable guest network” or “OK Google, ask NETGEAR to reboot my router.”</p><p> The router has two USB 3.0 storage ports on the back for connecting an external hard drive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Software: Nighthawk App**<p> In the Nighthawk app, you can change your router’s settings, create a guest network, control your router remotely, manage your devices individually, and you can test your network speeds.

probably need.</strong></p><p> The Nighthawk RAX120 performs impressively, but it‘s costly and lacks some user-friendly features like strong parental controls and easy-to-manage antivirus, so it’ll be more desirable for those with heavier networking demands than the average user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4708689&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible-converter-interface.png"                      border="0"                >Epubor Audible Converter for Win： Download and convert Audible AAXC&#x2F;AA&#x2F;AAX to MP3 with 100% original quality preserved.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). Otherwise,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >Fortnite Battle Royale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is free and available on almost every major platform: PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition packs all the functionality of an Amazon Fire TV streaming device right into its chassis. This 55-inch LED smart TV combines affordability with Alexa, Amazon Prime content, and access to over 500,000 episodes across your favorite streaming platforms. We thoroughly tested the Toshiba’s picture quality, display settings, and the Fire OS interface and usability.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pCLBMqSK1Hi3ePW2jzUkDycA2IU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_04-f1f62a55ea504fc9aa98fc9e14527ba7.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room"><a href="#Design-Best-for-a-bigger-room" class="headerlink" title="Design: Best for a bigger room"></a><strong>Design: Best for a bigger room</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55-inch Fire TV is not a small device. While it only weighs 31.3 pounds with the stand (though the stand itself weighs less than a pound), it’s both tall and wide enough to make moving and installing it a two-person job. The TV’s dimensions with the stand are 27.8 inches tall, 44.6 inches wide, and 10.7 inches deep, and the screen size (on a diagonal) measures at 49.5 inches.</p><p> There’s no wall mount included in the box, but there are four standard VESA mounting holes on the back of the unit for safe and easy installation. In a smaller space, wall-mounting this television might not be a bad idea. Even in the relatively modestly-sized room where we tested the TV, it nearly completely took up the entire shelf where we placed it and a broad swath of the wall behind it. This TV is not particularly thin and actually tends to be a bit bulky in the very back of the unit, and the stand also adds width. The legs splay out and require a wide, long surface to accommodate them.</p><p> An attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.</p><p> The other important component is the Alexa-enabled remote, which is small, lightweight, and contains a circular dial with directional controls and play&#x2F;pause functionality. You also have the benefit of summoning Alexa with the touch of the speaker button, which is intuitively placed at the top of the remote (though we often accidentally hit it when we were trying to push the Home button, which is right below it).</p><p> The buttons are clearly laid out on the remote, and it’s convenient to have volume and mute controls in addition to a shortcut button to antenna channels. There are also some shortcut buttons as well: Prime Video, Nextflix, HBO, and Vue.</p><p> There are some downsides to the remote’s overall quality. Unlike other Fire TV remotes that create a completely smooth and seamless effect on the back, this remote is a lot more traditional, with a tab for pulling off the battery cover. It makes an unfortunate creaking noise almost every time you push a button, and while it never fell off the noise was distracting and contributed to the plastic and flimsy feel of the remote.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/bohXBE5CBPeYtI5seooxoQhyzkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_02-781cfad0cacf41878e3ffb24afd56c6e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> There is a little setup required out of the box, whether you wall mount it or attach the stand. We chose the latter and found the instructions to be straightforward. Each leg requires both a longer 35 mm screw to help create a secure attachment to the bottom of the TV and two 10 mm screws that secure the legs to the back of the unit.</p><p> Installing the legs isn’t complicated, but it can be awkward because you need to place the TV screen-side down on a soft or cushioned surface. It helps to have a bit of space to do this either on a sofa or a clean, carpeted area, and maybe a helping hand to situate the TV wherever you plan to put it.</p><p> Once the legs were in place, we placed the TV on a table and plugged in the power cord. The TV powered on immediately and we were prompted to press the play&#x2F;pause button on the remote to begin setup.</p><p> We were guided through a quick process of connecting to Wi-Fi, signing in with Amazon account credentials, and registering the TV to our account. While you can enjoy this television without an existing Amazon account, you will have to create one in order to complete setup and gain access to all apps. The whole setup only takes a few moments, though, and we were on the Home screen of the Fire OS interface before we knew it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gg5qCbaSxBZF2n4hLJ-UWMjX7vk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_05-ea81ea03abde49c3856c921f1321d024.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-sometimes-needs-tweaking" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp but sometimes needs tweaking</strong></h2><p> While setting up the TV was very fast and took only a few minutes, we did have to spend some time adjusting the picture settings. Unfortunately, this is not something the online user manual provides much insight about.</p><p> We headed straight for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> content on Amazon Prime and played a number of movies and TV series. What we found was that it consistently took about a minute for the picture to kick into Ultra HD<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The default standard picture settings yielded an incredibly dark picture with too much contrast. The reds were very exaggerated and the low-light scenes, especially scenes at night, were very difficult to see.</p><p> Accessing the HDR picture settings is not exactly intuitive. Long-pressing the Home button on the remote brings up a shortcut menu and that’s where we were able to access HDR picture settings. Picture settings can be found under Display and Sounds in the main Settings menu, but there’s only a blanket setting for all app and video content. Settings that work for regular HD content, which was the majority of the content we viewed, were inadequate for HDR content.</p><p>Ultra HD HDR content shines in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> For the best Ultra HD HDR picture quality, we found that changing to movie mode instead of standard smoothed out the saturation a bit. For good measure we also turned off Dynamic Backlight, HDR Tone Mapping, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mpeg-file-2622031" >MPEG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Noise Reduction. This helped the Ultra HD HDR content shine in a realistic and rich way.</p><p> Another image quality issue we encountered was<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macroblocking-and-pixelation-1847333" >video artifacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which are glitches and distortions in picture quality. This can be a result of data loss due to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-media-file-compression-1847431" >media file compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , signal interference, or other factors. It was a particular problem when viewing HD Amazon Prime content, but we also observed it in Hulu content. Turning off Edge Enhancer and Motion Processing from the picture settings menu helped eliminate artifacting when streaming media, but it didn’t resolve this issue when we watched live TV via Hulu. There we got long sequences of pixelated content and macroblocking, where the image appeared broken up into blocky chunks.</p><p> We did switch the picture mode to Game when playing an HD game, but didn’t notice a significant difference in quality. The picture was already quite vibrant and clear without making this switch, and the only discernible difference was that Game mode made color tones a bit more saturated. Presumably the panel is deactivating some post-processing to improve input lag, but we didn’t notice a significant difference in either quality or latency.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KHIDIBlAKmxc6ZGa6AocjOoGEpY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_06-1fe0d195f3844b89822833f4c0f4d69e.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Well-rounded-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Well-rounded and clear</strong></h2><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 is outfitted with two 10-watt speakers enhanced with DTS Studio Sound. According to DTS, this technology smooths transitions, volume, and bass levels while changing channels or sources.</p><p> Audio quality isn’t spectacular but is generally consistent and clear across media. The volume can get quite loud and fill the room, which is good if you don’t plan to add additional home-entertainment speakers. There are also bass, treble, and balancing settings that help cater to your individual EQ preferences.</p><p> Like the suite of picture settings, there are sound modes to achieve the most appropriate audio experience based on what media you’re consuming. These modes include Standard, Movie, Music, Clear Voice, and a user-defined Custom mode. Movie mode seemed to work out best for our preferences, yielding neither an extremely tinny nor bassy sound.</p><p> There are also the DTS TruSurround and TruVolume controls—TruSurround is on by default and functions to create a richer and more amplified sound, but TruVolume is off. Flipping it on helped control and even out fluctuations in sound, which was a problem we encountered streaming some content on Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FdoBEgX__hYz6EgBVAeh47z5pyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_03-39faf55a89c8450cbddcb795f2f0fcc8.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered"><a href="#Software-Easy-to-use-but-cluttered" class="headerlink" title="Software: Easy to use but cluttered"></a><strong>Software: Easy to use but cluttered</strong></h2><p> This Toshiba TV runs on Fire OS, which is easy to interact with but has some quirks. As an Amazon product it feature Amazon Prime content first and foremost, which may be convenient for Prime subscribers but is slightly less so if you’re primarily looking for Netflix or Hulu content. We found that the remote occasionally lagged if we didn’t point it directly toward the TV sensors, and virtually any time we loaded and exited apps or spun up Prime content. Loading time varied from a few seconds to upwards of ten. There’s also an odd bug when exiting out of the Hulu app. It routinely took about five seconds before the system got us back to the Home dashboard, before which it would take us to the Hulu home page.</p><p> The Fire OS Home menu is the spot that features recent apps, downloaded apps, as well as suggested content based on viewing activity. This arrangement is clear enough, but wading through options becomes more confusing based on the other menu pages, which include Movies, Live, TV Shows, Apps, and Your Videos. Much of the content you’ll see across these pages is duplicated, so overlap is a part of the user experience, which means clutter and confusion. Once you get a handle on this arrangement it’s easy enough to wade through, but a more streamlined layout would be welcome.</p><p> One way to avoid what can feel like a labored navigation experience is to use Alexa. But that doesn’t always make the process any easier. When testing commands like “Tune to ABC” in Hulu Live, we encountered a bunch of error messages. Searching the whole system for content through Alexa can make your life easier. Doing so brings up a menu of choices, displaying content availability on various streaming platforms as well as whether content is free or available for rent or purchase. Once you make a decision, Alexa takes you directly to the content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/grEHZxJFIUgX8TcaLouLrOiXNUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4061017_07-a8725babe7be46ad86619a83a5ca972a.jpg"                      alt="Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience"><a href="#Price-Affordable-way-to-enjoy-4K-and-upgrade-your-streaming-experience" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience"></a><strong>Price: Affordable way to enjoy 4K and upgrade your streaming experience</strong></h2><p> At around $450, the Toshiba Fire TV Edition is an attractive option for shoppers who want a smart 4K TV under $500.

This smart 4K television retails for under $400 and blends 4K Ultra HD quality with HDR, resulting in vivid and exceptional picture quality for the price. The Roku TV is not only cheaper than the Toshiba Fire TV Edition, but it’s also 1 pound lighter despite being both slightly taller, wider, and deeper than the Toshiba 55LF711U20.</p><p> The other benefit of the Roku TV is the interface, which is more streamlined than the Fire OS dashboard. If you’re not overly enthusiastic about Alexa or Google Assistant, you could choose to integrate either down the line with the Roku—since it’s compatible with both—or forego them altogether. Alternatively, the Roku app also offers a handy mobile remote and voice control. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber you’ll still have easy access to that content through the Prime app, though it won’t be as prominent, which is actually a boon.</p><p> Consider some of our other picks for the best cheap TVs or the best TVs under $500.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A capable smart TV for active Amazon Prime users.</strong></p><p> The Toshiba 55LF711U20 55-inch Fire TV Edition is a big, bold, affordable 4K smart TV that’s ideal for Amazon Prime subscribers and Alexa users.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk is a powerful gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a surprisingly decent value to those that lack the time or ability to build a gaming desktop from scratch. I say this, reluctantly, as someone who has spent his entire life building gaming desktops by hand, not to mention countless video editing workstations for coworkers at the various places I’ve been employed. All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink"

GPT-4 is the successor to GPT-3 and has access to more parameters, a better understanding of context, and enhanced problem-solving skills. It turns out that it’s also quite good for learning a new language.</p><p> Whether you want to improve your French-speaking skills or pick up some German, GPT-4 is surprisingly capable. It can help you build your vocabulary, learn grammar and syntax, and even learn a bit about culture.</p><h2 id="1-What’s-the-Best-Place-to-Start"><a href="#1-What’s-the-Best-Place-to-Start" class="headerlink" title="1.

ChatGPT recommends that you set clear goals, learn vocabulary in context, listen to and mimic native speakers, and take notes. All of this is solid advice.</p><p> It continues by saying that it can help answer questions about grammar and pronunciation, recommend resources, and offer cultural insights.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-translate-with-chatgpt/" >ChatGPT can also provide simple translations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This structures our learning approach better: we now know exactly what we need to ask from ChatGPT during our course of learning a language.</p><p> It’s important to keep in mind that you pick a language that’s relatively easy to learn. English speakers find learning languages such as Mandarin, Russian, and Japanese hard. While ChatGPT can write in all languages, you’re better off getting a tutor if you want to nail the pronunciation and overall fluency for the more complex languages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Building-Your-Vocabulary"><a href="#2-Building-Your-Vocabulary" class="headerlink" title="2.

You want to learn how to pronounce common words and understand how&#x2F;why they are used in various situations. As you can imagine, GPT-4’s conversational skills can easily handle this process.</p><p> We asked ChatGPT to help us in building our French vocabulary. To be more specific, we told ChatGPT about our proficiency in French and that we wanted recommendations for common words used in daily life. It quickly gave us a list of 20 common words and phrases and their meanings.</p><p> An interesting thing of note is that it also explained the pronunciation of each word. This is because we specified that we wanted to improve our speaking skills. We gave the same prompt to GPT-3.5, and it gave us the same list but without the pronunciations.</p><p> The result shows that GPT-4 has a better understanding of context in comparison to its predecessor. This is just one of the many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gpt-4-vs-gpt-35-differences-explained/" >differences between GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Practice-Conversational-Skills"><a href="#3-Practice-Conversational-Skills" class="headerlink" title="3.

With ChatGPT, you can hold conversations in any language you want. For example, we asked ChatGPT to talk with us in French, and the result was impressive.</p><p> ChatGPT understood our prompt immediately and gave us a sentence in French. We then responded to that sentence, and the conversation kept going from there. Throughout this conversation, it critiqued our conversational skills and provided small suggestions.</p><p> GPT-3.5 also worked well here. However, it responded with much longer responses and, at times, completely forgot to critique our writing&#x2F;speaking skills. It still works, but you’ll have to occasionally remind the language model about its mistakes.</p><h2 id="4-Learn-Grammar-and-Syntax"><a href="#4-Learn-Grammar-and-Syntax" class="headerlink" title="4.

ChatGPT can help you learn the grammar and syntax rules by providing real-time feedback, explanations, and examples during written interactions.

While learning a language with ChatGPT, you can ask for cultural context, references, and social norms that are present in the language. This helps you understand how native speakers communicate.</p><p> You can also get insights into cultural phenomena such as historical events, festivals, celebrations, and more. Then, you can ask ChatGPT to provide you with resources such as movies, books, and music in the language you’re trying to learn. The key here is to ask anything you can think of about the language and culture.</p><h2 id="7-How-Does-It-Compare-to-Other-Alternatives"><a href="#7-How-Does-It-Compare-to-Other-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="7.

While traditional language learning apps rely on pre-programmed responses, ChatGPT Plus can provide a more personalized and tailored experience. This way, ChatGPT can adapt to your individual needs and set the pace accordingly.</p><p> You also get detailed explanations, examples, and cultural insights about the language and the people who speak it.

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

well</li></ul><p> While many of the best external optical drives go for a smaller form factor, making them easier to travel, this pick for top performance goes big. The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly. It also supports BDXL, allowing storage of up to 128GB on a single, compatible disc. Making the package even sweeter, the ASUS BW-16D1X-U supports Windows and Mac computers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-review-4774686" >Asus BW-16D1X-U Powerful Blu-ray Drive Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >LG GP65NB60 External Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Txzj4YX23tuIUnOsOlRGMfzEON8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-electronics-8x-usb-20-super-multi-ultra-slim-portable-dvd-writer-drive---rw-external-drive-with-m-disc-support-black-gp65nb60-e74c64d858fc4e968d809333a31078d1.jpg" >LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 Super Multi Ultra Slim Portable DVD Writer Drive +&#x2F;-RW External Drive with M-DISC Support (Black) GP65NB60 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Reads and writes CDs and DVDs</li><li>Lightweight and very portable</li><li>You have color options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Cheap build quality</li><li>Poorly designed eject function</li></ul><p> If you don’t need the Blu-ray capabilities offered by some of the more premium external optical drives, you can get a great deal on a CD&#x2F;DVD drive. LG’s GP65NB60 is a low-profile and affordable combo drive that offers both read and write capability for CD and DVD. Measuring 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches and weighing just 0.4 pounds, it even gives our top compact pick a run for its money.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 can read CD-ROM at 24x speeds and DVD-ROM at 8x speeds, meaning it’s not lagging behind most of the competition despite its budget price. Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4727541&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/copy_copy_forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Gold Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight. But that reduction wouldn’t be valuable if you need an optical drive.</p><p> Measuring just 0.45 x 5.24 x 5.75 inches, the Verbatim 70102 is super compact. What’s more, the reduction in size doesn’t mean a bunch of compromises. It’s built with metal housing for a premium look and feel and is speedy.</p><p> It can write CDs at 24x, DVDs at 8x, and Blu-rays at 6x — even supporting M-Disc. It’s a CD&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;BD drive weighing less than half a pound. The Verbatim 70102 is a mobility champion, with power and data transfer over USB, so you’ll only need one cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Alternative"><a href="#Budget-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Budget Alternative"></a>Budget Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >Dell DW316 External USB Slim DVD Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXbXWSHrSmk0WgSQeogs9WgkNz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316--black-5ec791f7068744c3bc87e2e91130a9c1.jpg" >dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316–black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >$26 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EXT-USB-SLIM-DVD-RW-OPTICAL-DRIVE-429-AAUX/44933803" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-usb-slim-dvd-rw-drive-plug-and-play-dw316-black/4697703.p?skuId=4697703" >$40 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works immediately</li><li>Includes DVD burning software</li><li>Easy to move around</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>A bit pricey for what you get</li><li>Flimsy exterior</li></ul><p> The Dell DW316 measures 0.55 x 5.41 x 5.67 inches, making it both a budget and compact contender.

It boasts maximum read speeds of 24x for CDs and 8x for DVDs, and it can provide those same speeds for writing as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Compact-Alternative"><a href="#Compact-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Compact Alternative"></a>Compact Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >ASUS ZenDrive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FMO3nyGMV3u3QFC7RoNQrMLyTbg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zendrive-ultra-slim-usb-20-external-8x-dvd-optical-drive---rw-with-m-disc-support-for-windows-and-mac-and-nero-backitup-for-android-devices-3c25db5d367c4a90ba3a66757967b883.jpg" >BackItUp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A27IUUM?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB01A27IUUM" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-zendrive-8x-max-dvd-write-speed-external-usb-2-0-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/6285911.p?skuId=6285911" >$38 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1224925-REG/asus%5Fsdrw%5F08u7m%5Fu%5Fblk%5Fg%5Fas%5Fzendrive%5Fu7m%5Fexternal%5Fultra%5Fslim.html" >$30 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Slim design</li><li>Optional encryption functionality</li><li>Ships with software included</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t work with Blu-rays</li><li>Might be loud at times</li></ul><p> Where a compact footprint counts, ASUS’s ultra-slim ZenDrive is a quality pick. This simple CD&#x2F;DVD combo drive does not support Blu-Ray, so it comes at a substantially lower price. It measures just 0.55 x 5.33 x 5.61 inches, and it needs a single USB connection for power.</p><p> The ZenDrive offers excellent performance for its size, with CD read and write speeds up to 24x and DVD read and write speeds up to 8x. Furthering that performance are quick access times; the Asus ZenDrive can access CD and DVD content in 160ms. For anyone who needs archival quality, the ZenDrive also supports burning to M-Disc for long-lasting data storage.</p><p> The Asus ZenDrive supports Windows and Mac, and it includes CyberLink software to help you get started storing content on physical media. The drive also comes with six months of free cloud storage from ASUS, so you can rip content from your CDs and DVDs and move it there as needed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> For people who own and consume lots of media, an indispensable external optical drive is one of your best bets. External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively.

When you look at this product, you see a thick, rubber-and-plastic frame that actually stands a chance of saving your delicate<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from a drop. A lot of budget cases feel cheap and flimsy both on and off of the laptop, but the UAG Laptop Case is more substantial.</p><p> The one-piece design and thick shell are billed to help shield from dents and scratches. The robust rubber padding along the edges of the case also helps to absorb impact from bumps and drops, protecting the frame of the laptop in its entirety. Along the spine of the computer, you’ll find a patch of rubber with a particularly tactile grip, which helps to prevent your laptop from falling out of your hands, even in damp conditions.</p><p> The style of the case is naturally more utilitarian than it is sleek.</p><p> With the case on, all ports are easily accessible. The snap closure is so secure that you need not worry about your laptop opening in transit or in your bag. But this snap closure can make it difficult to open again later (so much so that I was afraid I’d chip one of my freshly-painted nails when I tried).</p><p> The case fits tightly onto the laptop, which helps to keep the computer safe overall but also makes it difficult to remove. Of course, if you don’t plan to take your MacBook out of the case often and maximum protection is a priority, then this probably isn’t a dealbreaker.</p><p> The style of the case is naturally more utilitarian than it is sleek, but that’s usually the tradeoff for something that offers such protection. And despite the extra protection, there seems to be a sufficient amount of ventilation on the bottom of the case.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8sq4AYsbhOuB90hMOUtdeXMcaFg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4153328-2-5987a4064c7a4932a172493350ec5000.jpg"                      alt="Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Hayley Prokos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-one-time-deal"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-one-time-deal" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A one-time deal"></a><strong>Setup Process: A one-time deal</strong></h2><p> On the UAG website, you’ll find a YouTube video designed to guide users through the installation of the case. You should watch it before installing it yourself in order to avoid scratching or otherwise damaging your MacBook Pro.</p><p> Getting the case off is much harder than getting it on the computer.</p><p> Beware of the fact that getting the case off is much harder than getting it on the computer.

The sturdy appearance is backed by a military drop test rating (the case is advertised to have endured 25 drops from 4 feet high with no damage). The extra protection neither compromises the ventilation nor access to the ports.</p><p> The only hassle we encountered when testing usability was the snap closure, which is great for keeping your laptop shut in transit but difficult to pry open when trying to use your computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg"                      border="0"                >CollageIt Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/9Y7LLmqrhHo_Pbzks49nRtjt4ws=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4153328-4-49105513ae5d4a97ac284ce462185b5d.jpg"                      alt="Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Hayley Prokos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.devart.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=5023555&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/45b430710ad04765a6afd58d9d9fafca/products/dotConnect_O.png"                      border="0"                >dotConnect for Oracle is an ADO.NET data provider for Oracle with Entity Framework Support.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Durability-As-tough-as-it-gets"><a href="#Durability-As-tough-as-it-gets" class="headerlink" title="Durability: As tough as it gets"></a><strong>Durability: As tough as it gets</strong></h2><p> We found the UAG MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case to be as resilient as it could be.

View your LinkedIn bio as a concise summary of your professional background, skills, and aspirations.</p><p> Give ChatGPT a list of all your winning qualities, or copy-paste your CV into it. Ask the chatbot to compose a professional bio using the information. Make sure you specify its maximum length.</p><p> Proofread what the AI produces, and add missing details that would make a good impression. You can have ChatGPT edit or completely rewrite the new draft to your specifications.</p><p> When done, paste the bio into your LinkedIn<strong>About</strong> field. The more compelling it is, the higher your chances of getting an interview for that cool job you found on LinkedIn.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Write-Job-Descriptions"><a href="#2-Write-Job-Descriptions" class="headerlink" title="2.

You may need to edit the results or generate a new description in a different style or tone to satisfy your needs.</p><p> On your LinkedIn profile, what you should end up with under each job title are a few concise and easy-to-read lines.

ChatGPT can write them for you. You’d then have personalized message templates for greeting recruiters, requesting job details, arranging interviews, and more.</p><p> In each case, specify what the message is for, how the AI should express it, and what you want it to contain. For example, if you know your addressee’s name, include it. If you’re detailing your availability and have times and dates to share, ask ChatGPT to neatly list them.</p><p> As always, check the chatbot’s results for errors or clunky phrasing. Most importantly, personalize the message templates you use in different interactions, making sure they fit naturally and benefit you as a job candidate.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Write-Cover-Letters"><a href="#4-Write-Cover-Letters" class="headerlink" title="4.

You could paste the LinkedIn job ad into the prompt or manually type in its requirements and how you satisfy them. Specify that you need a professional cover letter.</p><p> The chatbot will take all that data and construct a formal response to the position’s specifications, sometimes with fields for you to fill in your name and contact details, for example.</p><p> Keep in mind that the information you provide the AI will determine the points it’ll try to make to support your job application. So, structure your prompt carefully for the best outcome. And don’t forget to customize ChatGPT’s letter and make it your own.</p><h2 id="5-Build-a-Resume"><a href="#5-Build-a-Resume" class="headerlink" title="5. Build a Resume"></a>5.

You can paste everything into a single document.</p><p> Something else ChatGPT can help you with when job hunting on LinkedIn is understanding what you should include in your resume or cover letter when applying for any job. The AI will break down what you need clearly and concisely.

Even better, ChatGPT can produce great answers to potential interview questions.</p><p> Just paste a question into the prompt and ask the chatbot to suggest responses. Not only does it come up with good options, but it also explains the reasoning behind them. You can memorize them verbatim or practice tailoring them to different interview situations.</p><p> Either way, you’ll be better prepared to face interviewers and outshine your competition for the LinkedIn job you want.</p><h2 id="7-Plan-and-Edit-Posts"><a href="#7-Plan-and-Edit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="7.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-Nokia-105-Classic"><a href="#How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-Nokia-105-Classic" class="headerlink" title="How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Nokia 105 Classic"></a>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Nokia 105 Classic</h2><p>Almost all Android phones feature an application that allows third-party apps to track your exact GPS location. However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters.

Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Motorola ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Motorola  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Motorola  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Motorola  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Motorola  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Motorola  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Motorola Razr 40 device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Motorola Razr 40 without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit.

If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used.

Dr. Fone Virtual Location will show your actual location on the map in the next window.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2. ExpressVPN"></a>2. ExpressVPN</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg"                      alt="how to fake location by expressvpn"                ></p><p>ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location. And while some tools require you to root the Android device, the ones suggested here do not necessitate any provisions; at most, you will have to tinker with developer options on Android (refer to the FAQ section for more on this).</p><h3 id="1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa"><a href="#1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Moto G34 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Moto G34 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Motorola  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.
