You may need to perform partition recovery when your hard drive partitions run into an error and don’t appear in File Explorer.</p><p><a href="#collapsethree">How does ‘Quick Scan’ differ from ‘Deep Scan’?</a></p><p> ‘Quick Scan’ helps you scan the selected drive faster. This mode is helpful in all data loss or deletion cases on Windows-based storage drives. Whereas ‘Deep Scan’ does a comprehensive, file signature-based search to maximize data recovery chances in tough data loss such as drive formatting, corruption, etc. Deep Scan is particularly useful when files couldn’t be found with ‘Quick Scan.’</p><p><a href="#collapsefour">Can I run Stellar Data Recovery Professional on a dual monitor setup?</a></p><p> You can run the software on a dual monitor setup and perform multiple tasks without switching or minimizing the screens. In addition, the feature helps perform complex data tasks such as recovering from corrupted or lost partitions with precision and ease.</p><p><a href="#collapsefive">Can I recover a specific file with the help of Stellar Data Recovery Professional software?</a></p><p> ‘Quick Scan’ performs a faster scan on your selected drive or volume. This mode of scan is used in almost all cases of data loss or deletion on Windows-based storage drive. Whereas ‘Deep Scan’ does a comprehensive file signature-based search to maximize recovery in tough cases of data loss such as drive formatting, corruption, etc. Deep Scan is particularly useful for recovering the files that couldn’t be found with ‘Quick Scan.’</p><p><a href="#collapsesix">Can I recover a specific file with the help of Stellar Data Recovery Professional software?</a></p><p> Yes. The software comes with an ‘Add File-Type’ feature that lets you add files even with a unique extension and perform data recovery. Besides this, you can run custom data recovery by choosing a particular type of data from the software’s ‘Select What to Recover’ screen.</p><p><a href="#collapseseven">Does Stellar Software recover data from optical drives?</a></p><p> The software can recover data from scratched, corrupted, or partially burnt optical media such as CDs, DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray discs.

A kernel panic is a sign of a fatal error that has occurred on your mac and could potentially lead to data loss. The causes of kernel panics could be very vast. They could be either: a) Software related b) Hardware related Software could be something on your macOS, it could be an application that is installed or downloaded from somewhere or it could be something on the hardware. It could be your hard drive itself, it could be RAM, it could be the motherboard or logic board inside of the computer or something not playing well or failing or having an interference with something else could be one of the reasons that a kernel panic occurs. It really depends on the severity of the kernel panic but sometimes just a simple reboot of your mac could get your mac starting up again so having one kernel panic is not a massive issue especially if you can reboot it and it’s fine but if it happens more than once, be careful. We would recommend backing up all of your data if it happens regularly. You’re going to need to go and get some advice because you may get one fatal kernel panic that you will not be able to recover from. There are a couple of screens that you just want to be aware of if you are encountering some sort of a kernel panic, it could be like a white screen or a gray screen. Steps to fix Kernel Panic on Mac: 00:00 Introduction 01:35 Step 1- Boot Mac into Safe Mode 02:03 Step 2 - Reset NVRAM&#x2F;PRAM 02:28 Step 3 - Use the Disk Utility 03:40 Step 4 - Reinstall macOS 04:20 Step 5 - Create a Recovery Disk Get Stellar Dara Recovery Free Edition* software: <a class="link"   href="https://www.stellarinfo.com/free-mac-data-recovery.php" >https://www.stellarinfo.com/free-mac-data-recovery.php <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> *The free edition version can recover up to 1GB data totally free of cost. So, now you know a little bit more about kernel panic, why it happens and what steps you can be trying but as said at the very start if this is something that is occurring regularly we would recommend getting some expert advice because it could lead to a more catastrophic failure. #MacKernelPanic #HowToFixKernelPanic #KernelPanicError Thank you so much for spending the time and watching this video.

A kernel panic is a sign of a fatal error that has occurred on your mac and could potentially lead to data loss. The causes of kernel panics could be very vast. They could be either: a) Software related b) Hardware related Software could be something on your macOS, it could be an application that is installed or downloaded from somewhere or it could be something on the hardware. It could be your hard drive itself, it could be RAM, it could be the motherboard or logic board inside of the computer or something not playing well or failing or having an interference with something else could be one of the reasons that a kernel panic occurs. It really depends on the severity of the kernel panic but sometimes just a simple reboot of your mac could get your mac starting up again so having one kernel panic is not a massive issue especially if you can reboot it and it’s fine but if it happens more than once, be careful. We would recommend backing up all of your data if it happens regularly. You’re going to need to go and get some advice because you may get one fatal kernel panic that you will not be able to recover from. There are a couple of screens that you just want to be aware of if you are encountering some sort of a kernel panic, it could be like a white screen or a gray screen. Steps to fix Kernel Panic on Mac: 00:00 Introduction 01:35 Step 1- Boot Mac into Safe Mode 02:03 Step 2 - Reset NVRAM&#x2F;PRAM 02:28 Step 3 - Use the Disk Utility 03:40 Step 4 - Reinstall macOS 04:20 Step 5 - Create a Recovery Disk Get Stellar Dara Recovery Free Edition* software: <a class="link"   href="https://www.stellarinfo.com/free-mac-data-recovery.php" >https://www.stellarinfo.com/free-mac-data-recovery.php <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> *The free edition version can recover up to 1GB data totally free of cost. So, now you know a little bit more about kernel panic, why it happens and what steps you can be trying but as said at the very start if this is something that is occurring regularly we would recommend getting some expert advice because it could lead to a more catastrophic failure. #MacKernelPanic #HowToFixKernelPanic #KernelPanicError Thank you so much for spending the time and watching this video.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-ZTE-Nubia-Z60-Ultra"><a href="#How-to-Fake-GPS-on-Android-without-Mock-Location-For-your-ZTE-Nubia-Z60-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra"></a>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra</h2><p>Almost all Android phones feature an application that allows third-party apps to track your exact GPS location. However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit.

Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well.

Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the ZTE Blade A73 5G device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your ZTE Blade A73 5G without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the ZTE Blade A73 5G device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your ZTE Blade A73 5G without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the ZTE Axon 40 Lite device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your ZTE Axon 40 Lite Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your ZTE Axon 40 Lite Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”.

However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature.

Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”.

However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5.

Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3.

NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it!

Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Xiaomi Redmi A2+ device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature.

Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.
