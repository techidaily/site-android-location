I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Samsung ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Samsung  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Samsung  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Samsung  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A05" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A05</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Samsung  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Samsung Galaxy A05 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Samsung ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Samsung  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Samsung  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Samsung"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Samsung Galaxy A05 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Samsung , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Samsung </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one. The screen supports ten-point touch so you can pinch-to-zoom or even finger paint on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Of course, MSI, like every other PC OEM, feels compelled to tout the computer’s AI features and how they integrate with the screen. The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service.

NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C12?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C12?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C12"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C12" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C12"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C12</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C12?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C12?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C12 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C12 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Samsung ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Samsung  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Samsung  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Samsung  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Samsung-Galaxy-A24" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy A24</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Samsung  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Samsung ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Samsung  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Samsung  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Samsung"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123738/7443" target="_top" id="2123738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Samsung , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Samsung </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Samsung  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

On the Virtual Location page, choose the <strong>Get Started</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="download virtual location and get started"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Dr. Fone Virtual Location will show your actual location on the map in the next window. If the location displayed is inaccurate, choose the <strong>Center On</strong> icon present in the lower-right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location map interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Choose the <strong>Teleport mode</strong> icon (the third one in the upper right corner) to change the GPS location on your Samsung Galaxy A24.</p><ul><li>In the upper-left section, <strong>type in the desired location</strong>.</li><li>And click <strong>Go</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. For instance, let’s say you wanted to spoof your location to Rome.

You can use it to stimulate movements along the route (with two or multiple spots). If you want more flexible GPS control, you can use your joysticks. Plus, it allows you to import GPX of different paths and save them to view later.</p><p>That said, scroll down to discover other two methods to fake GPS location on Android devices, such as Samsung, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-fake-gps-location-on-xiaomi.html" >Xiaomi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</p><h2 id="Solution-2-Change-location-on-Android-phone-by-VPNs"><a href="#Solution-2-Change-location-on-Android-phone-by-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs"></a>Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs</h2><p>Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.</p><p>And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

ExpressVPN</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg"                      alt="how to fake location by expressvpn"                ></p><p>ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location. And while some tools require you to root the Android device, the ones suggested here do not necessitate any provisions; at most, you will have to tinker with developer options on Android (refer to the FAQ section for more on this).</p><h3 id="1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa"><a href="#1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="1.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Samsung Galaxy A24 location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide!

More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049378/7443" target="_top" id="2049378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Samsung Galaxy A24 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144279/7443" target="_top" id="2144279">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144279" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144279/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers. However, outside in the backyard, the speed reduced to 111 Mbps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106658/12108" target="_top" id="2106658">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106658" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106658/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-display-screen"><a href="#Key-Features-A-display-screen" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A display screen"></a><strong>Key Features: A display screen</strong></h2><p> The touchscreen on the front of the main router can display the time, total GB, WAN and Router IP addresses, internet speeds, and port statuses.

You can optimize the priority level for each of your devices between normal, streaming, or gaming.</p><p> You can also set up parental controls and control your system remotely. The app is extremely user friendly and simple to navigate. There are a few more advanced features, like assigning static IPs and port forwarding, but overall the app is designed for the average user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2X1DxWPlS1VXqnwsUCG5qviJXwc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_03-56584e48b76942519745c71443c2e8d5.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-A-little-steep"><a href="#Price-A-little-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little steep"></a><strong>Price: A little steep</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system isn’t cheap. The package I tested, which came with the router and two mesh points, retails for $340. You can find mesh systems for much less, and of course, some mesh systems are much more expensive. But, the Amplifi system’s design, easy setup, and feature set help justify the price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123731/7443" target="_top" id="2123731">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123731" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123731/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> A Nest Wi-Fi package sells for around the same price as the Amplifi system. However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points. The Nest system points also serve as Google Assistant speakers, and the system features some more advanced technologies (like WPA3 encryption). However, one big issue with the Nest system is that it only has two Ethernet ports, while the Amplifi router has four spare ports.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Looks better than it performs.</strong></p><p> The Amplifi HD mesh system is attractive and does provide coverage for a huge area, but it doesn’t deliver lightning-fast speeds in a home with dozens of connected devices.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplifi HD Mesh Wi-Fi System</li><li>Product Brand  Ubiquiti</li><li>Price  $340.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.9 x 3.9 x 3.9 in.</li><li>Aggregate Speed  5.25 Gbps</li><li>Security  WPA2</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Wi-Fi standards  802.11ac</li><li>MIMO  3 x 3</li><li>IPv6 compatible  Yes</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4 Gigabit LAN ports</li><li>Range  20,000 square feet</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li><li>Remote connect  Yes</li><li>What’s included  Amplifi HD Router, two mesh points, power and Ethernet cables, guides</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-your-aspects-of-sound-and-sight-in-asmr-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevate Your Aspects of Sound and Sight in ASMR Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-experts-guide-to-video-editors-picking-between-filmora-and-democreator-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert's Guide to Video Editors Picking Between Filmora and Democreator for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-hilarious-threads-the-tweeter-treasury/"><u>[Updated] Hilarious Threads The Tweeter Treasury</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-piecing-together-engaging-stream-previews/"><u>[Updated] Piecing Together Engaging Stream Previews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-pros-and-cons-gopro-hero-4-vs-drift-ghost-s-racing-edition/"><u>[Updated] Pros & Cons GoPro Hero 4 Vs.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Oppo  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Oppo-F23-5G"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Oppo-F23-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Oppo F23 5G"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Oppo F23 5G</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Oppo  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Oppo F23 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Oppo ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Oppo  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Oppo  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Oppo"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Oppo F23 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Oppo , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Oppo </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Oppo  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery.

Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Tecno Phantom V Flip device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Vivo T2x 5G device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Vivo T2x 5G without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Honor ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Honor  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Honor  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor X8b?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor X8b?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-X8b"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-X8b" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor X8b"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor X8b</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor X8b?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor X8b?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-X8b" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor X8b"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor X8b</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor X8b device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor X8b device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

You can establish this strategy in two ways</p><ul><li>Using GPS Spoofing</li><li>VPN</li></ul><h3 id="What-does-GPS-Spoofing-mean"><a href="#What-does-GPS-Spoofing-mean" class="headerlink" title="What does GPS Spoofing mean?"></a>What does GPS Spoofing mean?</h3><p>The basic concept in GPS spoofing is that you are going to mock GPS Android via the radio signal received from satellites. The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Xiaomi 14 device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Xiaomi 14 without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Xiaomi  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi 14 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi 14 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3.

NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Motorola ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Motorola  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Motorola  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Moto G24 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Moto G24 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Motorola Moto G24 device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone -

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Motorola ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Motorola  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Motorola  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Edge 2023"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Edge 2023</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Motorola  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Edge-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Edge 2023</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Motorola  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Edge 2023 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Edge 2023 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android.

However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk is a powerful gaming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >desktop PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a surprisingly decent value to those that lack the time or ability to build a gaming desktop from scratch. I say this, reluctantly, as someone who has spent his entire life building gaming desktops by hand, not to mention countless video editing workstations for coworkers at the various places I’ve been employed. All this to say that I’m an advocate for building your own PC, but I still believe the OMEN is a pretty good value for a lot of people.</p><p> As configured, our HP OMEN Obelisk came equipped with Intel’s 9th gen i9-9900K and Nvidia’s GTX 2080 Super, a top-tier combination that makes light work of just about any game you might throw its way. All this comes at a cost for this tiny enclosure, however, and the components get very hot under load. The i9-9900k is an absolute furnace of a CPU to begin with, and the single 120mm AIO water cooler can only do so much.</p><p> How has HP reconciled all these things, and what does it mean for potential owners? Let’s take a look at the performance, build quality, and usability of this space-conscious gaming desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OXMiCXvzh8P7esVvbjPoSorzoxM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-2-7b14850c2ca84af39d5fd116ab483d5d.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027167/19272" target="_top" id="2027167">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027167" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027167/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations"><a href="#Design-Nice-looks-and-small-footprint-with-many-reservations" class="headerlink" title="Design : Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations"></a><strong>Design</strong> : <strong>Nice looks and small footprint, with many reservations</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close. Overall, HP did a pretty decent job here, but there are plenty of areas for improvement.</p><p> The first area of concern is the chassis itself. The shell of the OMEN case is constructed mainly out of plastic, which I’m sure helping a lot to keep shipping costs down, but definitely keeps the desktop from feeling like a solid, premium piece of hardware. It also makes me concerned about how durable it will be over time. Most buyers looking to spend this much on a gaming PC want to get some good mileage out of it, so this is somewhat disconcerting.</p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk looks good in pictures but starts to fall apart a little when examined up close.</p><p> The top&#x2F;front of the case features 2x USB 3.1 ports, a microphone and headphone port, and a power button. The USB ports are slightly misaligned on the model that I received making it a bit of a chore to plug anything in. I would love to have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the front here since more and more peripherals are moving towards USB-C. An SD card reader would also have been nice for those out there that shoot video and photos, but I realize not everyone shares the same needs.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent. The side of the case features a simple button release, so getting inside is extremely painless. If you are planning on adding more hard drives, HP has pre-wired two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009" >SATA cables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and SATA power connectors for you, and a plastic tray is present in the two drive bays for easy mounting.</p><p> Upgraders and tinkerers will also find a mixed bag full of things to love and things to resent.</p><p> Beyond adding more RAM or storage, you’re going to hit a wall pretty quickly. There are no mounts for additional fans to be installed anywhere, and there isn’t room in the case for many other CPU cooling options, should you be unhappy with the thermals. The pre-installed 120mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >AIO water cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is no match for the i9-9900k, where temperatures regularly crested 90°C during heavy workloads.</p><p> The OMEN gets plenty of things right as well. The plastic design might not be my favorite, but I absolutely adore the compact form factor. To put it in perspective, my already somewhat modest mid-tower case, the NZXT H440, measures 8.6 x 20.2 x 18.9 inches (HWD). The Omen, on the other hand, measures just 6.5 x 14.06 x 17.05 inches. Side by side, it’s plainly visible how much smaller the OMEN is, and for those with limited desk space, this will make a noticeable difference.</p><p> The lighting system is also approachable and understated, giving a little bit of customizable flare without going too over the top. As you’ll see later in the software section, HP has made it very straightforward to tweak any of these settings to your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gfeGQoUwG35q5t-JwO07Ax4jm5I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-3-f4e655ec9e684a47855e9ee7373ba4b6.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity"><a href="#Performance-Great-components-for-gaming-and-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Performance :Great components for gaming and productivity"></a><strong>Performance</strong> :<strong>Great components for gaming and productivity</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk that I tested featured a 9th Gen Intel Core i9 9900K, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super graphics card. This is a potent combination of components in a gaming PC, and I was appropriately impressed by the results.</p><p> The desktop scored an impressive 6,967 in the productivity-focused benchmarking application PCMark 10. On the gaming front, the Omen managed a score of 10,740 in 3DMark’s Time Spy. In real-world use, this means more than 60fps at 4K in many popular titles like GTA V, but less than 60fps in others like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. In other words, the Omen is mostly capable of 4K gameplay and is nearly always capable of 60+ fps in most common resolutions shy of 4K.</p><p> The Omen comes equipped with a 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-m2-833453" >NVMe SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and 32GB of DDR4 2666 memory. This is definitely more RAM than games alone will call for, but it’s merely an adequate amount of RAM for some creative professionals working with more demanding software like Adobe After Effects. Keep in mind though, even those that don’t normally need a lot of RAM can still benefit from having more. Among other things, it gives you the luxury of keeping all of your browser tabs and background applications running without having to start juggling applications on and off, which can be helpful from a productivity standpoint.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles"><a href="#Gaming-Great-for-the-most-demanding-titles" class="headerlink" title="Gaming :Great for the most demanding titles"></a><strong>Gaming</strong> :<strong>Great for the most demanding titles</strong></h2><p> Gaming performance is great on the HP OMEN Obelisk thanks to the Nvidia GTX GeForce 2080 Super and Intel i9-9900K combo. I tested a number of games on my 3440x1440 monitor to get a sense of performance. To put this in perspective, this resolution is roughly 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K monitor.</p><p> First up was GTA V, which I tested with everything except for MSA (anti-aliasing) and the settings in the advanced tab turned up to Very High, the maximum setting. I recorded an average of 120.6fps across the 5 passes that the benchmark runs.</p><p> Emboldened by these results, I went back and turned every last thing up to its maximum setting, including everything in the advanced tab_and_ 8x MSA. I was quickly brought back down to earth, with an average result of 46.6fps. For one last pass, I nudged the MSA down to 4x, and came up with a healthy average of 66.8fps. Maybe dreams can come true after all.</p><p> Next, I wanted to try something fairly CPU intensive, so I ran the in-game benchmark for Civilization VI. I used the default settings for the Ultra preset, which netted me an average of 145.5fps. This was certainly an easy win for the OMEN Obelisk.</p><p> Lastly, I ran the notoriously resource-heavy Deus Ex: Mankind Divided using a few different profiles. On Ultra settings, the OMEN Obelisk saw just 55.7fps on average, with a minimum of 44.6fps and a maximum of 61.6fps. Dialing things down one level to Very High, things looked only slightly rosier: 58.1fps average, 49.5fps minimum, 62.2fps maximum. Finally, turning it down one more level to High found a sweet spot: 75.8fps average, 62.8fps minimum, 96.6 FPS maximum.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pz9tV-mhJl_Cjm8HSqEQ_VZPbVE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-5-cdbd9d78a8c14b8e8bce0113d12e9fcc.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137378/7443" target="_top" id="2137378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-but-software-that-doesn’t-do-much" class="headerlink" title="Network :Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much"></a><strong>Network</strong> :<strong>Great speeds, but software that doesn’t do much</strong></h2><p> The HP Omen Obelisk has gigabit LAN and a Wi-Fi 5 (2x2) networking, the latter supporting a maximum speed of 866 Mbps. Everything functioned smoothly from a networking standpoint during my tests.</p><p> I made a point to try out the Network Booster software found in the OMEN Command Center and didn’t see anything tremendously useful, unfortunately. I tried setting the priority of Steam to “Low” and downloading a game, but the game still downloaded at my maximum internet speed. I took it one step further and toggled the “Block” option for Steam, and tried to resume the download, but Steam kept on downloading at the maximum speed. The software was successful in blocking Chrome when that option was switched on, however.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135355/19272" target="_top" id="2135355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135355/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Just-enough-options"><a href="#Software-Just-enough-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Just enough options"></a><strong>Software: Just enough options</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk comes with the OMEN Command Center, which is used to manage your desktop as well as any other OMEN products such as headsets, keyboards, and mice. From here, you have the option to click on your desktop and start managing your PC or choose from one of the various other options such as rewards, coaching, remote play, and My Games (a game launcher).</p><p> Select OMEN DESKTOP and you can access system vitals like GPU utilization, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and CPU&#x2F;GPU temperatures. This is also where you can access the lighting profiles, overclocking options, and a “network booster” that lets you prioritize application bandwidth usage.</p><p> The lighting is executed fairly well on the HP OMEN Obelisk. There are only two lighting zones: one for the interior of the case, and one for the logo on the front exterior. Through the OMEN Command Center, you can set and customize lighting profiles for each zone. You can choose a static color, but also may choose from animation profiles that cycle between preset or user-defined colors. Luckily you can also choose the brightness, if you want to tone down the lighting a bit, and choose a separate profile for when the desktop is asleep.</p><p> The option to overclock your system has you first run a nondescript benchmark, which produces a score with no reference point (to establish a baseline). While it’s nice to have the option, this really,<em>sincerely</em> isn’t a system you want to be overclocking. The i9-9900K CPU already runs alarmingly hot, even with its pre-installed water cooling solution. There also isn’t enough room for anything beyond a 120mm AIO watercooler, and not nearly enough clearance for a popular air heatsink like the Noctua NH-D15.</p><h2 id="Price-Highly-competitive"><a href="#Price-Highly-competitive" class="headerlink" title="Price: Highly competitive"></a><strong>Price: Highly competitive</strong></h2><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk with the same specs as this one can be found for around $2,000, at least when it’s in stock. Despite a lot of flaws that I can point to a nit-pick about, the price is one of the main reasons I still consider the OMEN to be a solid deal. I went through the trouble of parting out a similar build on PCPartPicker, going as far as to cut corners where I usually wouldn’t, and still arrived at just under $1800 before tax.</p><p> As far as I’m concerned, $200 is a perfectly reasonable premium to pay for a system that is already assembled and shipped to your door.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J3cZUfrEy-ALtFpRbDRhw7FZI8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HP-OMEN-Obelisk-Gaming-Desktop-Computer-4-f78d504d7bd348eca19b7e65b4d10289.jpg"                      alt="HP OMEN Obelisk"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro"><a href="#HP-OMEN-Obelisk-vs-Corsair-One-Pro" class="headerlink" title="HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro"></a><strong>HP OMEN Obelisk vs Corsair One Pro</strong></h2><p> If you want something even smaller, and even more monolithic, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/corsair-one-pro-review-5072820" >Corsair One Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Systems/CORSAIR-ONE/CORSAIR-ONE-PRO-i180-Compact-Workstation-Grade-PC/p/CS-9040001-NA" >Corsair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) manages to pack a high-end gaming rig in a minuscule 12-liter case, making even the HP OMEN seem large by comparison. It has a very solid construction and manages to fit water cooling for both the CPU and GPU inside its small frame.</p><p> The Corsair One will of course be less customizable and harder to work in, and caps out at 32GB of RAM as opposed to the OMEN’s 64GB. The main differentiation however is the price—the Corsair One in a similar configuration to the OMEN will cost at least $900 more. Nonetheless, for those that really don’t plan to do any tweaking whatsoever, that value space above all else, might still consider the Corsair One.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>High performance and fantastic value, but upsetting thermals.</strong></p><p> The HP OMEN Obelisk delivers fantastic value for gamers shopping for a high-performance, pre-built PC. HP has come a long way, and now offers a much more compelling solution that will appeal to a much broader set of buyers. That said, there is work to be done still, as the case suffers from poor airflow, poor thermals, and not a lot of meaningful ways to improve them.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Omen Obelisk</li><li>Product Brand  HP</li><li>SKU  B07WQ68VR8</li><li>Price  $1,999.00</li><li>Release Date  August 2019</li><li>Weight  29 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  20.4 x 19.4 x 11.8 in.</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i9-9900K</li><li>Cooling  120mm AIO liquid cooling</li><li>Graphics  Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super</li><li>Memory  32GB RAM (expandable to 64GB)</li><li>Storage  1TB M.2 NVMe</li><li>Ports  7x USB 3.0, 1 headphone, 1x USB-C, 1x HDMI, 3x Display Port, 1x USB-C (display)</li><li>Power Supply  750W</li><li>Network  Wi-Fi 5 (2x2), Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.2</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-from-flat-to-fantastic-animated-text-transformations/"><u>[Updated] From Flat to Fantastic Animated Text Transformations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-gamified-design-making-your-youtube-banner-unforgettable-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Gamified Design Making Your YouTube Banner Unforgettable for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-record-ps4-with-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How To Record PS4 with OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-vivo-x90s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Vivo X90S | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-fixing-non-appearing-thumbnails-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>2024 Approved Fixing Non-Appearing Thumbnails in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-full-overview-of-installing-wm6/"><u>2024 Approved Full Overview of Installing WM6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/effective-techniques-to-compress-data-within-cells-using-microsoft-excel/"><u>Effective Techniques to Compress Data Within Cells Using Microsoft Excel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-android-without-mock-location-for-your-lava-storm-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Lava Storm 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-realme-12-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-ways-to-manage-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Easy Ways to Manage Your Samsung Galaxy A15 5G Location Settings | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-ways-to-manage-your-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Easy Ways to Manage Your Samsung Galaxy M14 5G Location Settings | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-vivo-y28-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Vivo Y28 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-heads-up-on-high-tech-the-best-motorcycle-cam-gear-guide-in-23/"><u>In 2024, Heads Up on High-Tech - The Best Motorcycle Cam Gear Guide in '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-8-vpn-hardware-devices-reviewed-on-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best 8 VPN Hardware Devices Reviewed On Itel S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong>. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Mock-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?</h2><p>Almost all Androids have the feature “Mock Location”. This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the “Developer” option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.</p><p>This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:</p><ul><li>First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.</li><li>It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.</li><li>Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Using-Location-Spoofer-to-Fake-GPS-Without-Mock-Location-and-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root"></a>Part 2: Using Location Spoofer to Fake GPS Without Mock Location and Root</h2><p>One app that allows you to <strong>fake GPS without mock location</strong> is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS&#x2F;Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare.

Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Realme Narzo N53 without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Realme Narzo N53 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Realme ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Realme  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Realme  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Realme"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Realme Narzo N53 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Realme , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Realme </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Infinix  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Infinix-Zero-30-5G"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Infinix-Zero-30-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Infinix Zero 30 5G"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Infinix Zero 30 5G</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Infinix  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Infinix ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Infinix  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Infinix  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Infinix"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Infinix , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Infinix </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Lava ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Lava  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Lava  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Lava  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Lava-Yuva-2-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Lava Yuva 2 Pro</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Lava  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Lava ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Lava  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Lava  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Lava"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134494/18498" target="_top" id="2134494">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134494" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134494/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Lava , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Lava </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Lava  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

ExpressVPN</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg"                      alt="how to fake location by expressvpn"                ></p><p>ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location. And while some tools require you to root the Android device, the ones suggested here do not necessitate any provisions; at most, you will have to tinker with developer options on Android (refer to the FAQ section for more on this).</p><h3 id="1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa"><a href="#1-Fake-GPS-location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="1.
