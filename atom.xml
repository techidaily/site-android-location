I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Honor ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Honor  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Honor  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-Vs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic Vs 2</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently.

This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Honor ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Honor  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Honor  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor Magic V2"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor Magic V2</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-V2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic V2</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor Magic V2 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor Magic V2 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well. Feel free to explore these apps and let us know about your experience of faking location on your Honor .

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor Magic 6 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p><strong>The best VPNs in the market:</strong> NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.</p><p>By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.</p><p>Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.</p><h2 id="Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps"><a href="#Solution-3-Get-a-Fake-mock-GPS-location-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps"></a>Solution 3: Get a Fake&#x2F;mock GPS location Apps</h2><p>You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-6-Lite"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-6-Lite" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic 6 Lite"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic 6 Lite</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor Magic 6 Lite device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor Magic 6 Lite device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service.

Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.</p><h4 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Cross-platform support</li><li>5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app</li><li>Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices</li></ul><p>You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Honor ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Honor  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-6"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Honor-Magic-6" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic 6"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor Magic 6</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor Magic 6 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Honor"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor Magic 6 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Honor </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Ideally, you should look for these parameters while downloading any fake location spoofer.</p><ul><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This is the first thing that you should check for any fake GPS app. It should be compatible with your phone and the other streaming, dating, or gaming app on which you wish to change your location.</li><li><strong>Developer background:</strong> There are so many fake location spoofer apps on the Play Store. The best way to filter them is by looking at the developer. That is, it should be from a trusted and reliable source.</li><li><strong>User rating:</strong> This is ideally the direct parameter for judging any app. The higher its rating, the better the app would be.</li><li><strong>User feedback:</strong> Apart from the app rating, you should also read the comments of other users. This will let you know their experience of using the location spoofer app.</li><li><strong>Last update:</strong> Ideally, the fake GPS spoofer app should be updated regularly. For instance, if its last update was made over a year ago, then it might not be a trusted app.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> Make sure that the app would only have an access to your device’s GPS and not any other feature. Also, it should not need any modification or root access on the Honor Magic 6 device.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android"></a>Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android</h2><p>Without much ado, let’s get to know about some of the best fake location spoofer apps that you can use for free.</p><h3 id="Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa"><a href="#Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="Fake GPS Location by Lexa"></a>Fake GPS Location by Lexa</h3><p>If you are looking for a reliable and lightweight fake GPS location spoofer free app, then give this one a go.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C32?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C32?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C32"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C32" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C32"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C32</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C32?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C32?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C32" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C32"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C32</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C32 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C32 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well. Feel free to explore these apps and let us know about your experience of faking location on your Nokia .

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C300?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C300?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C300"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C300" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C300"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C300</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C300?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C300?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1638364/17190" target="_top" id="1638364"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1638364"                      border="0" alt="" width="1280" height="720"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1638364/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C300" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C300"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C300</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C300 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C300 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2.

Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN).

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C22 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C22 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C210?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C210?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C210"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C210" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C210"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C210</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C210?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C210?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C210" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C210"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C210</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C210 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C210 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Pro"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Pro"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Pro</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C12 Pro device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C12 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded.

Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Plus<p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C12 Plus device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C12 Plus device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Plus"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Plus"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Plus</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C12 Plus device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="For-People-Wanting-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Devices"><a href="#For-People-Wanting-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12-Devices" class="headerlink" title="For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Devices"></a>For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Nokia C12 Devices</h2><p><em>“Hi! I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C12?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C12?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C12" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C12</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C12 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C12 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C110?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C110?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C110"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C110" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C110"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C110</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C110?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C110?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C110" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C110"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C110</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C110 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C110 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C02?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia C02?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C02"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-C02" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C02"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia C02</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C02?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia C02?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-C02" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C02"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia C02</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia C02 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia C02 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Nokia C02 location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Nokia C02 location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Nokia C02 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application. It works by hiding your GPS location and setting it to your preferred location.</p><p>The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQa-_8RTg5U" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>First, you need to download and install <strong>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</strong>, then run the application.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select “Virtual Location” from the drop-down menu, and connect your iPhone or Android phone to your computer through a USB cable.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="For-People-Wanting-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023-Devices"><a href="#For-People-Wanting-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023-Devices" class="headerlink" title="For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023) Devices"></a>For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023) Devices</h2><p><em>“Hi! I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-150-2023" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 150 (2023)?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia 150 (2023) device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia 150 (2023) device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Ideally, you should look for these parameters while downloading any fake location spoofer.</p><ul><li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> This is the first thing that you should check for any fake GPS app. It should be compatible with your phone and the other streaming, dating, or gaming app on which you wish to change your location.</li><li><strong>Developer background:</strong> There are so many fake location spoofer apps on the Play Store. The best way to filter them is by looking at the developer. That is, it should be from a trusted and reliable source.</li><li><strong>User rating:</strong> This is ideally the direct parameter for judging any app. The higher its rating, the better the app would be.</li><li><strong>User feedback:</strong> Apart from the app rating, you should also read the comments of other users. This will let you know their experience of using the location spoofer app.</li><li><strong>Last update:</strong> Ideally, the fake GPS spoofer app should be updated regularly. For instance, if its last update was made over a year ago, then it might not be a trusted app.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> Make sure that the app would only have an access to your device’s GPS and not any other feature. Also, it should not need any modification or root access on the Nokia 150 (2023) device.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-10-Free-Location-Spoofers-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android"></a>Part 2: 10 Free Location Spoofers on Android</h2><p>Without much ado, let’s get to know about some of the best fake location spoofer apps that you can use for free.</p><h3 id="Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa"><a href="#Fake-GPS-Location-by-Lexa" class="headerlink" title="Fake GPS Location by Lexa"></a>Fake GPS Location by Lexa</h3><p>If you are looking for a reliable and lightweight fake GPS location spoofer free app, then give this one a go.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Nokia ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Nokia  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Nokia  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 130 Music"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 130 Music</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-130-Music" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 130 Music</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia 130 Music device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times.

Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 105 Classic"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 105 Classic</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia 105 Classic device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia 105 Classic device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic-1"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 105 Classic"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Nokia 105 Classic</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Nokia  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic-1"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Nokia-105-Classic-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Nokia 105 Classic</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Nokia  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Nokia 105 Classic device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Nokia ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Nokia  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Nokia  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Nokia"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Nokia 105 Classic device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Nokia , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Nokia </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Nokia  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Motorola ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Motorola  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Motorola  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Motorola  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Motorola  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Motorola  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Razr-40" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Razr 40</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Motorola  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Razr 40 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Razr 40 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Motorola  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Motorola-Moto-G84-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Moto G84 5G"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Motorola Moto G84 5G</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Motorola  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Motorola Moto G84 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Motorola ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Motorola  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Motorola  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Motorola"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Motorola Moto G84 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Motorola , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Motorola </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Motorola  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.
