The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Infinix Note 30i device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Infinix Note 30i Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Infinix Note 30i Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN-1"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN-1"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Infinix Note 30i device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Infinix Note 30i Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Infinix Note 30i Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299"                      border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Oppo A1x 5G device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Oppo A1x 5G Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Oppo A1x 5G Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error.

From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Oppo A18 device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Oppo A18 without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Oppo  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store.

Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Oppo A18 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Oppo ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Oppo  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Oppo  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Oppo"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Oppo A18 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Oppo , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Oppo </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Oppo A1 5G device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Oppo A1 5G Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Oppo A1 5G Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus Open device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus Open Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus Open Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN-1"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your OnePlus Nord N30 SE location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your OnePlus Nord N30 SE location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your OnePlus  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it.

As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your OnePlus ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your OnePlus  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your OnePlus"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your OnePlus , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your OnePlus </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus Nord CE 3 5G Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my OnePlus ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from OnePlus  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, OnePlus  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on OnePlus Ace 3"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on OnePlus Ace 3</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your OnePlus  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-Ace-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus Ace 3</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a OnePlus  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the OnePlus Ace 3 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your OnePlus ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your OnePlus  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your OnePlus"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the OnePlus Ace 3 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your OnePlus , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your OnePlus </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus Ace 2V device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus Ace 2V Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus Ace 2V Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN-1"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN-1"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus Ace 2V device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-2" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus Ace 2V Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus Ace 2V Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location.

On this device, you should also navigate to ‘Developer Options.’ Next, choose ‘allow mock location to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/how-to-fake-gps-android-without-mock-location-8.jpg"                      alt="locate mock location on lg"                ></p><h3 id="3-Xiaomi"><a href="#3-Xiaomi" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can locate this number by visiting ‘settings’ and selecting ‘About Phone’ on the list of options. Once you tap on the number, you will see the ‘Allow Mock Location Apk’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/how-to-fake-gps-android-without-mock-location-9.jpg"                      alt="locate mock location on xiaomi"                ></p><h3 id="4-Huawei"><a href="#4-Huawei" class="headerlink" title="4.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your OnePlus Ace 2 Pro without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus Ace 2 device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus Ace 2 Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus Ace 2 Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the OnePlus Ace 2 device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your OnePlus Ace 2 without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the OnePlus 12 device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your OnePlus 12 Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your OnePlus 12 Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-OnePlus-12"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-OnePlus-12" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on OnePlus 12"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on OnePlus 12</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-12"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-12" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your OnePlus  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-12"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-12" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a OnePlus  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the OnePlus 12 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your OnePlus ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your OnePlus  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your OnePlus"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the OnePlus 12 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your OnePlus , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your OnePlus </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN-1"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web.

Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your OnePlus  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-11-5G"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-OnePlus-11-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus 11 5G"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus 11 5G</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a OnePlus  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the OnePlus 11 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your OnePlus ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your OnePlus  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your OnePlus"                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the OnePlus 11 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your OnePlus , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your OnePlus </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-8.jpg"                      alt="IP address to mask your location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN"><a href="#Difference-between-GPS-Spoofing-and-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN"></a>Difference between GPS Spoofing and VPN</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Elements to compare</strong></td><td><strong>GPS Spoofing</strong></td><td><strong>VPN</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tracks location</strong></td><td>Using radio signals</td><td>IP address</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make use of</strong></td><td>Satellite signals</td><td>Data with letters and numbers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spots the Nubia Z50S Pro device address</strong></td><td>The signal’s coordinate details</td><td>With unique combinations of numbers and letters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spoofing strategy</strong></td><td>Register wrong coordinate details</td><td>VPN provider offers a different set of IP address instead of the original data</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other features</strong></td><td>Threatens the security systems on the internet and give access to restricted apps and WebPages</td><td>Encrypt data and mask the location details for security purpose.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Virtual Location"></a>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</h3><p>1-Click Location Changer for both iOS and Android</p><ul><li>Teleport from one location to another across the world from the comfort of your home.</li><li>With just a few selections on your computer, you can make members of your circle believe you’re anywhere you want.</li><li>Stimulate and imitate movement and set the speed and stops you take along the way.</li><li>Compatible with both iOS and Android systems.</li><li>Work with location-based apps, like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>3981454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-fake-Android-location-by-GPS-spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing"></a>Part 3: How to fake Android location by GPS spoofing</h2><p>You must make some changes on your Nubia Z50S Pro Phone before installing the Fake GPS location app.</p><p>Step 1: In your Nubia Z50S Pro Phone go to the ‘Settings’ option and select ‘About Phone’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-9.jpg"                      alt="Settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: In the next window choose ‘Software Information’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-10.jpg"                      alt="Software Information"                ></p><p>Step 3: Tap on ‘Built Number’ in the preceding screen.

Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Nubia Z50S Pro device’s system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here’s a general method to change the GPS location on your Nubia Z50S Pro without rooting:</p><ul><li><strong>1. Enable Developer Options:</strong> Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on “About phone” or “About device.” Locate the “Build number” and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.</li><li><strong>2. Access Developer Options:</strong> Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see “Developer Options” listed. Tap on it.</li><li><strong>3. Enable Mock Locations:</strong> In the Developer Options menu, look for the “Mock location app” or “Allow mock locations” option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

If you haven’t installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for “Fake GPS” apps on the Google Play Store.</li><li><strong>4. Install a Fake GPS App:</strong> Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn’t require root access. Some popular options include “Fake GPS Location” or “Fake GPS Joystick &amp; Routes Go.” Install the app of your choice.</li><li><strong>5. Set the Fake Location:</strong> Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app’s interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.</li><li><strong>6. Start Mocking the Location:</strong> Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.</li><li><strong>7. Test the New Location:</strong> Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.</li></ul><p>If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2" >Part 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are varying purposes why you might want to fake your location.
