Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

On the Virtual Location page, choose the <strong>Get Started</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="download virtual location and get started"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Dr. Fone Virtual Location will show your actual location on the map in the next window. If the location displayed is inaccurate, choose the <strong>Center On</strong> icon present in the lower-right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location map interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>.

Of course, there is no need to root your device.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.</p><p>Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:</p><h3 id="1-SurfShark"><a href="#1-SurfShark" class="headerlink" title="1. SurfShark"></a>1. SurfShark</h3><p>SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).</p><h4 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap</li><li>3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.</li><li>Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline</li><li>Costly tool (US$ 2.30&#x2F;mo)</li></ul><h3 id="2-ExpressVPN"><a href="#2-ExpressVPN" class="headerlink" title="2. ExpressVPN"></a>2. ExpressVPN</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg"                      alt="how to fake location by expressvpn"                ></p><p>ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).</p><h4 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h4><ul><li>The fastest VPN service in the market</li><li>It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)</li><li>3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere</li><li>It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><ul><li>Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.</li><li>Above-average prices</li></ul><h3 id="3-NordVPN"><a href="#3-NordVPN" class="headerlink" title="3. NordVPN"></a>3. NordVPN</h3><p>Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN).

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error.

However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-5G"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Redmi-13C-5G" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi "                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well. Feel free to explore these apps and let us know about your experience of faking location on your Xiaomi .

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Xiaomi Redmi 12 location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Xiaomi Redmi 12 location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application.

Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.

From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone-1"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app-1"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone-1"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature-1"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone-1"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool-1"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool.

A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices. I have included app and device-related solutions to resolve the GPS not found 11 issues.

I’m Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Xiaomi ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Xiaomi  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Xiaomi  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS on the map"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3?"></a>Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3?</h2><p>As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Xiaomi  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-Civi-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi Civi 3</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi Civi 3 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi "                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi Civi 3 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go!

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error.

A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Xiaomi ?”</em></p><p>This is one of the many queries that we get from Xiaomi  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Xiaomi  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions.

A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.</p><p>The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Xiaomi 14 Pro"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Xiaomi 14 Pro</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Xiaomi  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14-Pro"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14 Pro"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14 Pro</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi 14 Pro device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi "                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi 14 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data).

The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Xiaomi  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions.

Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Xiaomi  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Xiaomi-14" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Xiaomi 14</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Xiaomi  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Xiaomi 14 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Xiaomi ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Xiaomi  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Xiaomi "                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Xiaomi 14 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Xiaomi , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Xiaomi </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Xiaomi  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices. I have included app and device-related solutions to resolve the GPS not found 11 issues. Though, if it still persists, then you can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS) to manually change the location of your iPhone without jailbreaking it.</p><h2 id="Getting-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Error-in-Xiaomi-13T-1"><a href="#Getting-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Error-in-Xiaomi-13T-1" class="headerlink" title="Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Xiaomi 13T"></a>Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Xiaomi 13T</h2><p><em><strong>“Every time I launch Pokemon Go, I get the GPS Signal not found 11 error on my Android.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network.

Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”</strong></em></p><p>As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11 banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues"><a href="#Part-1-Common-Reasons-for-the-Pokemon-Go-GPS-not-found-11-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?"></a>Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?</h2><p>Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.</p><ul><li>Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.</li><li>The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.</li><li>The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.</li><li>Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.</li><li>The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.</li><li>Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg"                      alt="pokemon gps signal 11"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-fix-the-GPS-Signal-Not-Found-11-Issue-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Vivo Y78+ (T1) Edition device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application.

The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.</p><p>All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg"                      alt="change in the location"                ></p><h3 id="What-is-a-VPN"><a href="#What-is-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="What is a VPN?"></a>What is a VPN?</h3><p>It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can</p><ul><li>Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques</li><li>Hide your IP address and mock the location</li><li>Get access to restricted areas on the web</li><li>Change your IP address as per your needs in no time</li></ul><p>The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Vivo Y78+ location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Vivo Y78+ location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Vivo Y78+ device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

On the Virtual Location page, choose the <strong>Get Started</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="download virtual location and get started"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Dr. Fone Virtual Location will show your actual location on the map in the next window.

I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices. I have included app and device-related solutions to resolve the GPS not found 11 issues.

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone.

At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices.

For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Vivo Y77t location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Vivo Y77t location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Vivo Y77t device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application. It works by hiding your GPS location and setting it to your preferred location.</p><p>The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQa-_8RTg5U" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>First, you need to download and install <strong>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</strong>, then run the application.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select “Virtual Location” from the drop-down menu, and connect your iPhone or Android phone to your computer through a USB cable.

Whether you use the “Center On” symbol or your Phone’s GPS to find your current location, you will always be in Rome, Italy.

For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t"><a href="#Part-2-Any-Precaution-or-Preparation-for-Mocking-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Vivo Y77t"></a>Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Vivo Y77t</h2><p>The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.</p><ul><li>Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.</li><li>Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.</li><li>It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.</li><li>Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.</li><li>A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.</li><li>Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Find-the-Best-Tool-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Vivo Y77t?"></a>Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Vivo Y77t?</h2><p>If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.</p><ul><li><strong>It is working&#x2F;compatible?</strong></li></ul><p>It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Vivo  phone.</p><ul><li><strong>It is safe to use?</strong></li></ul><p>Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.</p><ul><li><strong>Does it need rooting?</strong></li></ul><p>Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it spy your location?</strong></li></ul><p>There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.</p><ul><li><strong>It is pricey?</strong></li></ul><p>Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.</p><ul><li><strong>Will it support your apps?</strong></li></ul><p>If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.</p><ul><li><strong>What do other users think of it?</strong></li></ul><p>Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-3.jpg"                      alt="affected apps"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t"><a href="#Part-4-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Mock-GPS-on-Vivo-Y77t" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Vivo Y77t"></a>Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Vivo Y77t</h2><p>Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Vivo  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Vivo Y77t device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Vivo ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Vivo  phone:</p><p>Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options</p><p>To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Vivo  phone. To do this, go to its Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings &gt; About Device as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg"                      alt="Developer Options on your Vivo "                ></p><p>Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Vivo Y77t device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg"                      alt="mock location field"                ></p><p>Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App</p><p>Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg"                      alt="mock GPS app"                ></p><p>After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Vivo , go back to its Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg"                      alt="change the location"                ></p><p>Step 3: Fake location on your Vivo </p><p>That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg"                      alt="confirm to fake your location"                ></p><p>Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.</p><p>There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Vivo  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well. Feel free to explore these apps and let us know about your experience of faking location on your Vivo .

Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-1-Restart-Pokemon-Go-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone"></a>Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone</h3><p>The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App&#x2F;Play Store again and install the app on your device.</p><h3 id="Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone"><a href="#Fix-3-Reset-the-Location-Settings-on-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone"></a>Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone</h3><p>Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg"                      alt="android location option"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature"><a href="#Fix-4-Turn-off-the-Mock-Location-feature" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature"></a>Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature</h3><p>Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings &gt; Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg"                      alt="disable mock location android"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone"><a href="#Fix-5-Restart-your-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone"></a>Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone</h3><p>At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg"                      alt="android restart device"                ></p><p>Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.</p><h3 id="Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Fix-6-Toggle-On-and-Off-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode"></a>Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode</h3><p>If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="android airplane mode"                ></p><p>This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.</p><h3 id="Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone"><a href="#Fix-7-Reset-Network-Settings-on-your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone"></a>Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone</h3><p>Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings &gt; Backup &amp; Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg"                      alt="reset network settings android"                ></p><p>In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool"><a href="#Part-3-Fix-the-GPS-Not-Found-11-Error-with-a-Location-Spoofing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool"></a>Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool</h2><p>If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.</p><ul><li>You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.</li><li>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.</li><li>Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.</li><li>You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.</li><li>The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 5"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices. I have included app and device-related solutions to resolve the GPS not found 11 issues. Though, if it still persists, then you can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS) to manually change the location of your iPhone without jailbreaking it.</p><h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Manage-Your-Vivo-Y56-5G-Location-Settings"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Manage-Your-Vivo-Y56-5G-Location-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Manage Your Vivo Y56 5G Location Settings"></a>Easy Ways to Manage Your Vivo Y56 5G Location Settings</h2><p>Your <strong>Android location settings</strong> can be a handy tool in everyday life, ranging from finding your way around, knowing the weather, and searching for services offered around your area.</p><p>Location services on your Vivo Y56 5G or iPhone are one you’d find helpful when the need arrives! For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.</p><p>However, <strong>how do you manage your Vivo Y56 5G location settings</strong>? How can you turn on&#x2F;off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That’s precisely the purpose of this guide! So let’s get started on how you can manage your Vivo Y56 5G location settings!</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-location-services-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable location services on Android"></a><strong>Part 1: How to enable location services on Android</strong></h2><p>If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg"                      alt="Change android phone location"                ></p><ol><li>Head over to Settings on your android phone.</li><li>Click on “<strong>Location</strong>.”</li><li>You’d see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.</li><li>Click on the location mode, and you’d see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.</li><li>If a screen shows location consent, click ‘agree,’ and that’s all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-manage-and-understand-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services"></a>Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services</h2><p>Immediately you turn on your location services. You’d find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone&#x2F;device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.</p><h3 id="High-Accuracy"><a href="#High-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="High Accuracy"></a><strong>High Accuracy</strong></h3><p>When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.</p><p>This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.</p><h3 id="Battery-saving"><a href="#Battery-saving" class="headerlink" title="Battery saving"></a><strong>Battery saving</strong></h3><p>As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.</p><h3 id="Device-only"><a href="#Device-only" class="headerlink" title="Device only"></a><strong>Device only</strong></h3><p>If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Vivo Y56 5G device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you’re outside.</p><h3 id="Emergency-Location-services"><a href="#Emergency-Location-services" class="headerlink" title="Emergency Location services"></a><strong>Emergency Location services</strong></h3><p>When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device’s location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don’t want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Location-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Change Location on Android&#x2F;iPhone</h2><p>There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android&#x2F;iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:</p><p>One of the best ways to change location on android&#x2F;iPhone is installing and using a location changer application. It works by hiding your GPS location and setting it to your preferred location.</p><p>The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQa-_8RTg5U" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>First, you need to download and install <strong>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</strong>, then run the application.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select “Virtual Location” from the drop-down menu, and connect your iPhone or Android phone to your computer through a USB cable.

If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg"                      alt="close pokemon go app"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app-1"><a href="#Fix-2-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Pokemon-Go-app-1" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app"></a>Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app</h3><p>If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App&#x2F;Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go update"                ></p><p>If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first.
