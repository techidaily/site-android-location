## **Part 1: How to enable location services on Android**

If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:

1. Head over to Settings on your android phone.

5. If a screen shows location consent, click 'agree,' and that's all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!

## Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **High Accuracy**

When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.

This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.

### **Battery saving**

As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.

### **Device only**

If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Honor Play 7T device-only mode.

## Part 2: VPN vs. GPS spoofing: Which you need?

It is high time to explore unique effective ways to mock your location on the network. You can establish this strategy in two ways

- Using GPS Spoofing
- VPN

### What does GPS Spoofing mean?

The basic concept in GPS spoofing is that you are going to mock GPS Android via the radio signal received from satellites. The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.

All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.

![change in the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

### What is a VPN?

It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can

- Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques
- Hide your IP address and mock the location
- Get access to restricted areas on the web
- Change your IP address as per your needs in no time

The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.
