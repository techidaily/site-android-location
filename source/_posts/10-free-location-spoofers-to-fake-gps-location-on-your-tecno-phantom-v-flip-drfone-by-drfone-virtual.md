- **User feedback:** Apart from the app rating, you should also read the comments of other users. This will let you know their experience of using the location spoofer app.
- **Last update:** Ideally, the fake GPS spoofer app should be updated regularly. For instance, if its last update was made over a year ago, then it might not be a trusted app.
- **Security:** Make sure that the app would only have an access to your device’s GPS and not any other feature. Also, it should not need any modification or root access on the Tecno Phantom V Flip device.
