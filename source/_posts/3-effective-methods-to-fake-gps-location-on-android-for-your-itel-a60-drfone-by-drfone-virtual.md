**Step 5**. For instance, let’s say you wanted to spoof your location to Rome. Once you type in Rome in the teleport box, the program will show you a place in Rome with the **Move Here** option in the pop-up box.

- Click on **Move Here** to mock your location on Android.

## Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs

Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.

And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.

**Note**: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.

Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:

### 1\. SurfShark

SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).

#### Pros

- Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap
- 3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.
- Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)

#### Cons

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)

ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.

You can now access the Developer options directly in the Settings menu. Now, use the earlier method to set the location-spoofing app in the Developer options.

### 2\. Can Fake GPS be detected?

No. Most Fake GPS location apps aren’t detectable. However, if you are still unable to fake GPS location on Android using a third-party app, combine it with a VPN to also change your IP address.

These three are the most effective methods to fake GPS locations on Android. However, only [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) doesn’t necessitate any complicated steps.

**The other two:** VPNs and Fake GPS apps on Android, are effective, but you will have to follow tons of steps every time you want to mock location on Android devices.

## How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Itel A60

Almost all Android phones feature an application that allows third-party apps to track your exact GPS location. However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also **fake GPS without mock location**. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.

## Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?

Almost all Androids have the feature "Mock Location". This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the "Developer" option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.

This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:

- First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.
- It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.
- Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.

## Bonus Tip: How to Change GPS on Android without Root?

Rooting devices have an increased susceptibility to malware attacks. Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Itel A60 device's system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here's a general method to change the GPS location on your Itel A60 without rooting:

- **1\. Enable Developer Options:** Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on "About phone" or "About device." Locate the "Build number" and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.
- **2\. Access Developer Options:** Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see "Developer Options" listed. Tap on it.
- **3\. Enable Mock Locations:** In the Developer Options menu, look for the "Mock location app" or "Allow mock locations" option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven't installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for "Fake GPS" apps on the Google Play Store.
- **4\. Install a Fake GPS App:** Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn't require root access. Some popular options include "Fake GPS Location" or "Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go." Install the app of your choice.
- **5\. Set the Fake Location:** Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app's interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.
- **6\. Start Mocking the Location:** Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.
- **7\. Test the New Location:** Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.

If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in [Part 2](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2).
