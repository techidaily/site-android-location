![virtual location map interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 4**. Choose the **Teleport mode** icon (the third one in the upper right corner) to change the GPS location on your Tecno Spark 20.

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5**. For instance, let’s say you wanted to spoof your location to Rome. Once you type in Rome in the teleport box, the program will show you a place in Rome with the **Move Here** option in the pop-up box.

- Click on **Move Here** to mock your location on Android.

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

Once you select the Move Here option, your new location on the program’s map, as well as your Tecno Spark 20, will show as Rome, Italy.

As mentioned, Dr. Fone Virtual Location program can do more than just mock your location on Android devices. You can use it to stimulate movements along the route (with two or multiple spots).

That said, scroll down to discover other two methods to fake GPS location on Android devices, such as Samsung, [Xiaomi](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-fake-gps-location-on-xiaomi.html), etc.

## Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs

Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.

And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.

**Note**: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.

Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:

### 1\. SurfShark

SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).

#### Pros

- Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap
- 3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.
- Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)

#### Cons

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)

ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.

## Solution 3: Get a Fake/mock GPS location Apps

You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

### 1\. How To Enable Developer Options In Android?

You will have to enable Developer options and incorporate the fake GPS location app to spoof your location on your Tecno Spark 20.

Here’s how to enable the developer option:

You can now access the Developer options directly in the Settings menu. Now, use the earlier method to set the location-spoofing app in the Developer options.

### 2\. Can Fake GPS be detected?

No. Most Fake GPS location apps aren’t detectable. However, if you are still unable to fake GPS location on Android using a third-party app, combine it with a VPN to also change your IP address.

Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location is the best tool to prevent online services from detecting your actual location.

### 3\. Can you Fake your location on Grindr?

Yes. Dr. Fone's Virtual Location program is the best tool to fake your location on Grindr. It allows you to unlock several profiles at any desired location and discover more people.

## Wrap it Up

Once your fake GPS location is on Android successfully, you can stream restricted content on streaming services and mock your location on online services like dating apps, social media, and YouTube.

These three are the most effective methods to fake GPS locations on Android. However, only [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) doesn’t necessitate any complicated steps.

**The other two:** VPNs and Fake GPS apps on Android, are effective, but you will have to follow tons of steps every time you want to mock location on Android devices.

## Easy Ways to Manage Your Tecno Spark 20 Location Settings

Your **Android location settings** can be a handy tool in everyday life, ranging from finding your way around, knowing the weather, and searching for services offered around your area.

Location services on your Tecno Spark 20 or iPhone are one you'd find helpful when the need arrives! For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.

However, **how do you manage your Tecno Spark 20 location settings**? How can you turn on/off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That's precisely the purpose of this guide! So let's get started on how you can manage your Tecno Spark 20 location settings!

## **Part 1: How to enable location services on Android**

If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:

![Change android phone location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg)

1. Head over to Settings on your android phone.
2. Click on “**Location**.”
3. You'd see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.
4. Click on the location mode, and you'd see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.
5. If a screen shows location consent, click 'agree,' and that's all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!

## Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services

Immediately you turn on your location services. You'd find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone/device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.

### **High Accuracy**

When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.

This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.

### **Battery saving**

As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.

### **Device only**

If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Tecno Spark 20 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you're outside.

### **Emergency Location services**

When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device's location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don't want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.

## Part 3: How to Change Location on Android/iPhone

There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android/iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:

One of the best ways to change location on android/iPhone is installing and using a location changer application. It works by hiding your GPS location and setting it to your preferred location.

The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**

<iframe width="100%" height="450" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQa-_8RTg5U" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### 1\. Fake GPS location by Lexa

**Android App**:  [Fake GPS location by Lexa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en_IN&gl=US)

![how to fake location by lexa](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-by-lexa.jpg)

**Price**: Free

Free to use, Fake GPS location by Lexa allows you to change your location to anywhere in the world with just two clicks. Although exceptional, it does not work effectively on the newer Android 12 variants (rubber banding on the Google Play store). Plus, you will have to turn off your “Google location accuracy” and “Google location sharing” features for this to work.

### 2\. Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer

**Android app**: [Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.incorporateapps.fakegps.fre)

**Price**: Free; Premium available

![fake gps go location spoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-go-location-spoofer.jpg)

Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer is a premium tool, but most of its functions are free to use. Therefore, you do not have to upgrade unless you want to play games on Android devices. Moreover, it works without root on Android 6.0 and above variants. However, you will have to root the Android device on earlier versions.

### 3\. Fake GPS Location Professional

**Android app**: [Fake GPS Location Professional](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.just4funtools.fakegpslocationprofessional)

**Price**: Free

![ fake gps location professional](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-professional.jpg)

Fake GPS Location Professional is another free tool to deceive your GPS on Android devices. However, whenever you want to use it, you will have to go through Settings and mock your location manually every time.

For more information about Fake GPS Location Professional, you can check this [detailed review about Fake GPS Location Professional](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-location-pro-review-and-alternative.html)

### How to use Fake GPS Location to mock your location on Android devices?

For example, let’s use the first recommended tool, i.e., Fake GPS location by Lexa.

**Here’s a step-by-step guide to hiding your actual GPS coordinates using Fake GPS location by Lexa:**

**Step 1. Install** the [**Fake GPS location by Lexa app**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en) from the Google Play store.

![ fake gps location on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-8.jpg)

**Step 2**. Go to the **Developer option** on an Android device (**refer to the FAQ section** to learn how to enable Developer options on an Android device).

**Step 3**. In the Developer options:

- **Click on the Select mock location app option** to view all the Fake GPS locations installed on your Tecno Spark 20.

![ fake gps location on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-9.jpg)

- Add **Fake GPS Location by Lexa.**

![ mock gps location on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-10.jpg)

**Step 4.** Close the Settings after adding the Fake GPS location by Lexa in Developer options.

- **Open the Fake GPS Location by Lexa app.**
- And **choose the desired fake location**.

![ fake gps location on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-11.jpg)

### 1\. How To Enable Developer Options In Android?

You will have to enable Developer options and incorporate the fake GPS location app to spoof your location on your Tecno Spark 20.

Here’s how to enable the developer option:

- Open
- **Go to System.**

![ fake gps location on android10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-12.jpg)

- Navigate to **About Phone** and open it.

![ fake gps location on android11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-13.jpg)

- Choose the **Software info**

![ fake gps location on android12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-14.jpg)

- And click on **Build Number 7 times to see** the developer options screen.

![ fake gps location on android7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/fake-gps-location-on-android-15.jpg)

You can now access the Developer options directly in the Settings menu. Now, use the earlier method to set the location-spoofing app in the Developer options.

### 2\. Can Fake GPS be detected?

No. Most Fake GPS location apps aren’t detectable. However, if you are still unable to fake GPS location on Android using a third-party app, combine it with a VPN to also change your IP address.

Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location is the best tool to prevent online services from detecting your actual location.

### 3\. Can you Fake your location on Grindr?

Yes. Dr. Fone's Virtual Location program is the best tool to fake your location on Grindr. It allows you to unlock several profiles at any desired location and discover more people.

### 4\. Is it legal to fake GPS location on Android?

Yes, as long as you are not using them to engage in criminal activities.

## Wrap it Up

Once your fake GPS location is on Android successfully, you can stream restricted content on streaming services and mock your location on online services like dating apps, social media, and YouTube.

These three are the most effective methods to fake GPS locations on Android. However, only [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) doesn’t necessitate any complicated steps.

**The other two:** VPNs and Fake GPS apps on Android, are effective, but you will have to follow tons of steps every time you want to mock location on Android devices.
