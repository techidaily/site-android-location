## Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs

Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.

And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.

**Note**: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.

Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:

### 1\. SurfShark

SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).

#### Pros

- Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap
- 3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.
- Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)

#### Cons

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)

ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.
