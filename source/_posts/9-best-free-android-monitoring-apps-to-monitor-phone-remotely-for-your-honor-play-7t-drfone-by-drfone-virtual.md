As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.

### Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone

The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App/Play Store again and install the app on your device.

### Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone

Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.

![android location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg)

### Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature

Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings > Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.

![android restart device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg)

Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.

### Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode

If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.

![android airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg)

## Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool

If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.

- **1\. Enable Developer Options:** Similar to the previous response, you need to enable Developer Options on your device. Go to Settings, then tap on "About phone" or "About device." Locate the "Build number" and tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options.
- **2\. Access Developer Options:** Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see "Developer Options" listed. Tap on it.
- **3\. Enable Mock Locations:** In the Developer Options menu, look for the "Mock location app" or "Allow mock locations" option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven't installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for "Fake GPS" apps on the Google Play Store.
- **4\. Install a Fake GPS App:** Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn't require root access. Some popular options include "Fake GPS Location" or "Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go." Install the app of your choice.
- **5\. Set the Fake Location:** Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app's interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.
- **6\. Start Mocking the Location:** Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.
- **7\. Test the New Location:** Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.

If you think the way above is complicated for you, you can just use the easiest way: using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (GPS Changer) as introduced in [Part 2](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/fake-gps-android-without-mock-location.html#Part2).
