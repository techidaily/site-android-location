## Easy Ways to Manage Your Nokia G22 Location Settings

Your **Android location settings** can be a handy tool in everyday life, ranging from finding your way around, knowing the weather, and searching for services offered around your area.

Location services on your Nokia G22 or iPhone are one you'd find helpful when the need arrives! For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.

However, **how do you manage your Nokia G22 location settings**? How can you turn on/off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That's precisely the purpose of this guide! So let's get started on how you can manage your Nokia G22 location settings!

## **Part 1: How to enable location services on Android**

If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:

![Change android phone location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg)

1. Head over to Settings on your android phone.
2. Click on “**Location**.”
3. You'd see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.
4. Click on the location mode, and you'd see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.
5. If a screen shows location consent, click 'agree,' and that's all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!

## Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services

Immediately you turn on your location services. You'd find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone/device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.

### **High Accuracy**

When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.

This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.

### **Battery saving**

As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.

### **Device only**

If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Nokia G22 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you're outside.

### **Emergency Location services**

When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device's location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don't want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.

## Part 3: How to Change Location on Android/iPhone

There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android/iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:
