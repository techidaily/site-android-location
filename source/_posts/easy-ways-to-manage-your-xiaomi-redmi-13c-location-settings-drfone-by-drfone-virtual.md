## Easy Ways to Manage Your Xiaomi Redmi 13C Location Settings

Your **Android location settings** can be a handy tool in everyday life, ranging from finding your way around, knowing the weather, and searching for services offered around your area.

Location services on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C or iPhone are one you'd find helpful when the need arrives! For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.

However, **how do you manage your Xiaomi Redmi 13C location settings**? How can you turn on/off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That's precisely the purpose of this guide! So let's get started on how you can manage your Xiaomi Redmi 13C location settings!

## **Part 1: How to enable location services on Android**

If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:

![Change android phone location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg)

1. Head over to Settings on your android phone.
2. Click on “**Location**.”
3. You'd see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.
4. Click on the location mode, and you'd see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.
5. If a screen shows location consent, click 'agree,' and that's all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!

## Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services

Immediately you turn on your location services. You'd find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone/device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.

### **High Accuracy**

When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.

This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.

### **Battery saving**

As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.

### **Device only**

If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you're outside.

### **Emergency Location services**

When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device's location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don't want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.

## Part 3: How to Change Location on Android/iPhone

There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android/iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:

One of the best ways to change location on android/iPhone is installing and using a location changer application. It works by hiding your GPS location and setting it to your preferred location.

The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**

First, you need to download and install **Dr.Fone - Virtual Location**, then run the application.

**Step 1**: Select "Virtual Location" from the drop-down menu, and connect your iPhone or Android phone to your computer through a USB cable. To begin, click "Get Started."

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Turn on the "virtual location" functionality.

You can use Wi-Fi to connect the software to your iPhone once you've linked it to your computer through USB.

**Step 2**: You'll be taken to a new window where you can see a map of your current position. Click the "Center On" symbol in the lower right corner to see the proper place if it is not displayed correctly.

![tap on get started button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

![tap on move here button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 5**: Rome has been selected as your new home base. Whether you use the "Center On" symbol or your Phone's GPS to find your current location, you will always be in Rome, Italy. Your location-based app's location is, of course, in the same area as well. So that's where it's going to be shown.

_**“Every time I launch Pokemon Go, I get the GPS Signal not found 11 error on my Android. Can someone tell me how to troubleshoot the GPS not found 11 problems?”**_

As I read this query posted on an online forum, I realized that so many Pokemon Go players encounter a similar issue. The Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 errors can occur on any Android or iOS device. Since it is a location-based error, there are a couple of ways to fix it without harming your phone. In this post, I will help you overcome the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android and iOS devices in detail.

![pokemon gps signal 11 banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?

Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.

- Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.
- The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.
- The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.
- Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.
- The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.
- Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.

![pokemon gps signal 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-gps-signal-11.jpg)

## Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?

As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.

### Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone

The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.

![close pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg)

### Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app

If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App/Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App/Play Store again and install the app on your device.

### Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone

Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.

![android location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg)

### Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature

Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings > Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.

![disable mock location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg)

### Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone

At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.

![android restart device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg)

Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.

### Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode

If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.

![android airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg)

This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.

### Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone

Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings > Backup & Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.

![reset network settings android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg)

In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.

## Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool

If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.

- You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.
- It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.
- Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.
- You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.
- The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.

![virtual location 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

I’m sure that after reading this troubleshooting post, you would be able to fix the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 error on Android or iOS devices. I have included app and device-related solutions to resolve the GPS not found 11 issues. Though, if it still persists, then you can try [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS) to manually change the location of your iPhone without jailbreaking it.
