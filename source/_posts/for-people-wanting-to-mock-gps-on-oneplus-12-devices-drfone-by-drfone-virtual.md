## For People Wanting to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12 Devices

_“Hi! I'm Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my OnePlus ?”_

This is one of the many queries that we get from OnePlus  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, OnePlus  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!

![mock GPS on the map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Mock GPS on OnePlus 12?

As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.

The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.

## Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on OnePlus 12

The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.

- Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.
- Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.
- It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.
- Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.
- A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.
- Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.

![mock GPS feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12?

If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.

- **It is working/compatible?**

It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your OnePlus  phone.

- **It is safe to use?**

Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.

- **Does it need rooting?**

Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.

- **Will it spy your location?**

There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.

- **It is pricey?**

Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.

- **Will it support your apps?**

If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.

- **What do other users think of it?**

Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.

## Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on OnePlus 12

Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a OnePlus  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the OnePlus 12 device. Thus, you need to first turn on your OnePlus ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone:

Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options

To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your OnePlus  phone. To do this, go to its Settings > About Phone > Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings > About Device as well.

![Developer Options on your OnePlus ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg)

Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the OnePlus 12 device.

![mock location field](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg)

Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App

Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.

![mock GPS app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg)

After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your OnePlus , go back to its Settings > Developer Options > Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.

![change the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg)

Step 3: Fake location on your OnePlus 

That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.

![confirm to fake your location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg)

Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.

There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your OnePlus  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

## Part 2: VPN vs. GPS spoofing: Which you need?

It is high time to explore unique effective ways to mock your location on the network. You can establish this strategy in two ways

- Using GPS Spoofing
- VPN

### What does GPS Spoofing mean?

The basic concept in GPS spoofing is that you are going to mock GPS Android via the radio signal received from satellites. The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.

All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.

![change in the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

### What is a VPN?

It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can

- Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques
- Hide your IP address and mock the location
- Get access to restricted areas on the web
- Change your IP address as per your needs in no time

The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.

## Easy Ways to Manage Your OnePlus 12 Location Settings

Your **Android location settings** can be a handy tool in everyday life, ranging from finding your way around, knowing the weather, and searching for services offered around your area.

Location services on your OnePlus 12 or iPhone are one you'd find helpful when the need arrives! For example, you can quickly locate it anywhere on the map when it is turned on. Another benefit is that you can fast track your Phone when you lose it. The benefits of location services on your phone can never be over-emphasized.

However, **how do you manage your OnePlus 12 location settings**? How can you turn on/off GPS on Android and change phone location on Android? That's precisely the purpose of this guide! So let's get started on how you can manage your OnePlus 12 location settings!

## **Part 1: How to enable location services on Android**

If you use an Android phone, you can turn on your location services following these easy steps:

![Change android phone location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/android-location-settings.jpg)

1. Head over to Settings on your android phone.
2. Click on “**Location**.”
3. You'd see a toggle in a location where you can turn on and off GPS on Android. So toggle it to the right to turn it on.
4. Click on the location mode, and you'd see three different settings to select; High accuracy, Battery saving, and Phone only. Choose one mode. More details about which one to choose will be discussed below.
5. If a screen shows location consent, click 'agree,' and that's all; you have now turned on your location services on Android and can start enjoying all benefits!

## Part 2: How to manage and understand Location services

Immediately you turn on your location services. You'd find many settings and options like high accuracy, phone/device only, battery-saving, emergency location services, and other Google services. Here are what each means and how you can manage your android location services.

### **High Accuracy**

When you select this mode for your location services on Android, you want the most precise location tracking possible. This mode will prompt many networks like GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to work together and give you the best location tracking.

This mode comes in handy when navigating through streets searching for a particular location, as it gives a more accurate address than others.

### **Battery saving**

As the name already hints, this mode is best if you want to save the phone battery. GPS, one of the location services, uses lots of power, and in a bid to save your battery, this mode will turn off the GPS and use other tracking networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Although this mode might not provide the most accurate tracking possible, it will direct you rightly.

### **Device only**

If you are in a place with poor Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, the best way to manage your android location settings is to turn on the OnePlus 12 device-only mode. This feature prioritizes the inbuilt GPS radio signals over other networks. It functions just like cars, but, minds you, it consumes more battery power than different modes and will perform best when you're outside.

### **Emergency Location services**

When you dial or text an emergency number like 911, your device's location is available to emergency responders through Emergency Location Services. Only if local emergency responders rely on location data is this setting relevant. Even if you don't want your location to be shared with emergency services, your mobile provider has the option to do so.

## Part 3: How to Change Location on Android/iPhone

There are many reasons you might want to change your location on android/iPhone. It could be to get search results in a particular country, access online files, or access certain websites and applications. Whatever your reasons are, here are easy ways to change location on Android or iPhone:

The Dr.Fone-Virtual location application is one of the best location spoofers that change GPS location on Android and iPhone**.**
