## For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Sony Xperia 1 V Devices

_“Hi! I'm Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Sony ?”_

This is one of the many queries that we get from Sony  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Sony  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!

![mock GPS on the map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Sony Xperia 1 V?

As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.

The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.

## Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Sony Xperia 1 V

The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.

- Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.
- Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.
- It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.
- Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.
- A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.
- Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.

![mock GPS feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Sony Xperia 1 V?

If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.

- **It is working/compatible?**

It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Sony  phone.

- **It is safe to use?**

Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.

- **Does it need rooting?**

Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.

- **Will it spy your location?**

There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.

- **It is pricey?**

Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.

- **Will it support your apps?**

If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.

- **What do other users think of it?**

Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.

## Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Sony Xperia 1 V

Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Sony  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Sony Xperia 1 V device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Sony ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Sony  phone:

Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options

To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Sony  phone. To do this, go to its Settings > About Phone > Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings > About Device as well.

![Developer Options on your Sony ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg)

Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App

Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.

![mock GPS app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg)

Step 3: Fake location on your Sony 

That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.

![confirm to fake your location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg)

## Part 2: VPN vs. GPS spoofing: Which you need?

It is high time to explore unique effective ways to mock your location on the network. You can establish this strategy in two ways

- Using GPS Spoofing
- VPN

### What does GPS Spoofing mean?

The basic concept in GPS spoofing is that you are going to mock GPS Android via the radio signal received from satellites. The Global Positioning System works using the signals sent by various satellites like American GPS, European Galileo, Russian GLONASS, and Chinese BeiDou etc. Google started to make use of these signals in the year 2007 to implement the GPS systems in your mobile.

All these satellites emit signals continuously with unique coordinate parameters. The smart phones receive those signals along with coordinate details and the math algorithm calculates the location precisely. The coordinate details of the signals depend on the positioning of the satellites on the Earth’s orbit. Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.

![change in the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

### What is a VPN?

It is a Virtual Private Network and used for ages related to security needs. This concept deals with the IP address. Similar to the firewall in your PC this VPN serves as a protective curtain for the data on the web. With the help of a VPN, you can

- Encrypt the data on the web with a high level of encryption techniques
- Hide your IP address and mock the location
- Get access to restricted areas on the web
- Change your IP address as per your needs in no time

The VPN provider will assist you by serving a new IP address to mask your location. The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.
