**Here’s how to fake GPS location on Android using Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location:**

**Note**: You will need a USB cable, a computer, and an Android device.

**Step 1**. **Download and install** the [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your Windows or Mac device.

- **Open** the Dr. Fone Virtual Location program.
- From the main interface, choose **Virtual Location**.
- **Connect** your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition to the computer using a USB cable.

**Step 2**. On the Virtual Location page, choose the **Get Started** option.

![download virtual location and get started](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3**. Dr. Fone Virtual Location will show your actual location on the map in the next window. If the location displayed is inaccurate, choose the **Center On** icon present in the lower-right corner.

![virtual location map interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 4**. Choose the **Teleport mode** icon (the third one in the upper right corner) to change the GPS location on your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition.

- In the upper-left section, **type in the desired location**.
- And click **Go**.

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5**. For instance, let’s say you wanted to spoof your location to Rome. Once you type in Rome in the teleport box, the program will show you a place in Rome with the **Move Here** option in the pop-up box.

- Click on **Move Here** to mock your location on Android.

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

As mentioned, Dr. Fone Virtual Location program can do more than just mock your location on Android devices. You can use it to stimulate movements along the route (with two or multiple spots). If you want more flexible GPS control, you can use your joysticks. Plus, it allows you to import GPX of different paths and save them to view later.

That said, scroll down to discover other two methods to fake GPS location on Android devices, such as Samsung, [Xiaomi](https://drfone.wondershare.com/fake-location/how-to-fake-gps-location-on-xiaomi.html), etc.

## Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs

Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.

And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.

**Note**: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.

Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### 1\. SurfShark

SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).

#### Pros

- Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap
- 3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.
- Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)

#### Cons

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)





<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.

## Solution 3: Get a Fake/mock GPS location Apps

You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location. And while some tools require you to root the Android device, the ones suggested here do not necessitate any provisions; at most, you will have to tinker with developer options on Android (refer to the FAQ section for more on this).

## Part 1: How to Select Reliable Location Spoofers for Android

Before you get to know about the best fake GPS spoofer apps for Android, it is important to understand how to pick a suitable app yourself. Ideally, you should look for these parameters while downloading any fake location spoofer.

- **Compatibility:** This is the first thing that you should check for any fake GPS app. It should be compatible with your phone and the other streaming, dating, or gaming app on which you wish to change your location.
- **Developer background:** There are so many fake location spoofer apps on the Play Store. The best way to filter them is by looking at the developer. That is, it should be from a trusted and reliable source.
- **User rating:** This is ideally the direct parameter for judging any app. The higher its rating, the better the app would be.
- **User feedback:** Apart from the app rating, you should also read the comments of other users. This will let you know their experience of using the location spoofer app.
- **Last update:** Ideally, the fake GPS spoofer app should be updated regularly. For instance, if its last update was made over a year ago, then it might not be a trusted app.
- **Security:** Make sure that the app would only have an access to your device’s GPS and not any other feature. Also, it should not need any modification or root access on the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device.

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)

ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.

You can now access the Developer options directly in the Settings menu. Now, use the earlier method to set the location-spoofing app in the Developer options.

### 2\. Can Fake GPS be detected?

No. Most Fake GPS location apps aren’t detectable. However, if you are still unable to fake GPS location on Android using a third-party app, combine it with a VPN to also change your IP address.

Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location is the best tool to prevent online services from detecting your actual location.

### 3\. Can you Fake your location on Grindr?

Yes. Dr. Fone's Virtual Location program is the best tool to fake your location on Grindr. It allows you to unlock several profiles at any desired location and discover more people.

## Wrap it Up

Once your fake GPS location is on Android successfully, you can stream restricted content on streaming services and mock your location on online services like dating apps, social media, and YouTube.

These three are the most effective methods to fake GPS locations on Android. However, only [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) doesn’t necessitate any complicated steps.

**The other two:** VPNs and Fake GPS apps on Android, are effective, but you will have to follow tons of steps every time you want to mock location on Android devices.
