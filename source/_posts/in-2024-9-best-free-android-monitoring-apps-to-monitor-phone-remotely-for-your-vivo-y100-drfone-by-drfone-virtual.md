Here in the GPS spoofing technique mock the coordinate detail of the signals thereby leading to the change in the location.

- Hide your IP address and mock the location
- Get access to restricted areas on the web

The IP address (Internet Protocol) is a combination of numerals and alphabets separated by colon indicating the location of your device over the network. The original address is replaced with a new one directing to another location on the internet.
