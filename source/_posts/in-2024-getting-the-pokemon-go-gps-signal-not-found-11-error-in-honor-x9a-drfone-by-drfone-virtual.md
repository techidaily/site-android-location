As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.

### Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone

### Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app

If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App/Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App/Play Store again and install the app on your device.

### Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone

Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.

![android location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg)

### Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature

Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings > Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.

![disable mock location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg)

### Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone

At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.

![android restart device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg)

Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.

### Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode

If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.

![android airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg)

This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.

### Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone

Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings > Backup & Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.

In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.

## Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool

If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.

- You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.
- It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.
- Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.
- You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.
- The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.

## For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Honor X9a Devices

_“Hi! I'm Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Honor ?”_

This is one of the many queries that we get from Honor  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Honor  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!

![mock GPS on the map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Honor X9a?

As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.

The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.

## Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Honor X9a

The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.

- Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.
- Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.
- It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.
- Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.
- A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.
- Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.

![mock GPS feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Honor X9a?

If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.

- **It is working/compatible?**

It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Honor  phone.

- **It is safe to use?**

Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.

- **Does it need rooting?**

Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.

- **Will it spy your location?**

There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.

- **It is pricey?**

Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.

- **Will it support your apps?**

If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.

- **What do other users think of it?**

Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.

## Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Honor X9a

Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Honor  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Honor X9a device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Honor ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Honor  phone:

Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options

To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Honor  phone. To do this, go to its Settings > About Phone > Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings > About Device as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Developer Options on your Honor](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg)

Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Honor X9a device.

![mock location field](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg)

Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App

Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.

![mock GPS app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg)

After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Honor , go back to its Settings > Developer Options > Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.

![change the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg)

Step 3: Fake location on your Honor 

That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.

![confirm to fake your location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg)

Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.

There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Honor  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well. Feel free to explore these apps and let us know about your experience of faking location on your Honor . If you use any other mock GPS app that you wish to recommend our readers, then drop its name in the comments below!
