## Part 1: Common Reasons for the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issues?

Before we troubleshoot the GPS signal not found 11 errors in Pokemon Go, let’s quickly consider some of its common reasons.

- Chances are that your device might not be connected to a stable internet connection.
- The location services on your device might be disabled or not working.
- The Pokemon Go app might not be loaded properly on your phone.
- Pokemon Go might be corrupted or you could be running an outdated version of the app.
- The issue can also happen if you are using a mock location app on your device.
- Any other changed settings or app-related issues on your phone can also cause this error.

## Part 2: How to fix the GPS Signal Not Found 11 Issue in Pokemon Go?

As I have listed above, the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 problem can arise due to all kinds of reasons. Therefore, let’s have a look at numerous ways to fix the GPS not found 11 error in the game.

### Fix 1: Restart Pokemon Go on your phone

The simplest way to fix the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 issue is by restarting the game. If the app has not been loaded properly, then it would resolve this problem. All you need to do is tap on the app switcher button on your device to view all the apps running in the background. From here, swipe the Pokemon Go card to stop it from running. Afterward, restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS signal not found 11 Pokemon Go issue.

![close pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg)

### Fix 2: Update or Reinstall the Pokemon Go app

If you are using a corrupt or outdated Pokemon Go app, then you can get the GPS not found 11 error as well. Firstly, you can just go to the App/Play Store, look for Pokemon Go, and update the app.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

If you still get the Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error, then consider deleting the app first. Afterward, go to the App/Play Store again and install the app on your device.

### Fix 3: Reset the Location Settings on your phone

Since this is a location-based error, you can also consider resetting the location services on your phone. For this, just go to the Location Services (GPS) settings and toggle it off (and on). You can also go to the notification center and tap on the GPS icon to turn the service off and on again.

![android location option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-location-option.jpg)

### Fix 4: Turn off the Mock Location feature

Android users get the feature to set mock location on their phones, but it can also be a reason for getting the GPS not found 11 error. Therefore, if you are also getting the GPS signal not found 11 issue on your Android, then go to its Settings > Developer Options. From here, make sure that you have disabled any mock location app or settings on your phone.

![disable mock location android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-mock-location-android.jpg)

### Fix 5: Restart your Smartphone

At times, all it takes to fix an issue like Pokemon Go GPS not found 11 error is a simple restart of your phone. You can just long press the Power button on the side and choose to restart your phone from the power options.

![android restart device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-restart-device.jpg)

Now, just wait for a while as your phone would restart and launch Pokemon Go afterward to check if you still get the GPS not found 11 error.

### Fix 6: Toggle On and Off the Airplane Mode

If there is a network-related problem causing the GPS not found 11 error, then you can just reset the Airplane mode. At first, just go to the Control Center or the Settings of your device to enable the Airplane mode.

![android airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/android-airplane-mode.jpg)

This will automatically turn off its networks (like cellular data). Now, wait for a while, and turn off the Airplane mode to resolve the GPS not found 11 problems.

### Fix 7: Reset Network Settings on your Phone

Lastly, if nothing else seems to work, then you can reset the network settings on your phone as well. To do this, you can go to its Settings > Backup & Reset and tap on the “Reset Network Settings” under the Reset section.

![reset network settings android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/reset-network-settings-android.jpg)

In the end, you can choose to reset the network settings of your phone and wait for it to be restarted. This will erase the saved WiFi passwords and other network settings but might fix the GPS signal not found 11 errors on Android.

## Part 3: Fix the GPS Not Found 11 Error with a Location Spoofing Tool

If you use an iOS device and are getting the Pokemon Go GPS signal not found 11 errors on iPhone, then you can use a spoofing tool. I would recommend using [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) which can change the location of your iPhone to anywhere you like and fix these GPS-based errors.

- You can simply connect your iOS device to your system and use the application to change its location.
- It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that would let you enter the address or coordinates of the target location.
- Since the application would feature a map-like interface, you can drop the pin to the exact location of your choice.
- You can also use the application to simulate the movement of your phone between different spots at a preferred speed. A GPS joystick would also be included to customize your movement.
- The tool can spoof your iPhone location without any jailbreak access or harm your device.

## For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Vivo V30 Lite 5G Devices

_“Hi! I'm Jack and I play Pokemon Go in between classes or whenever I get free time from school. A lot of my friends use mock GPS on their phones to catch more Pokemons, but somehow I can’t seem to do the same. Can I also fake my location or use the mock GPS feature on my Vivo ?”_

This is one of the many queries that we get from Vivo  users who wish to mock GPS on their phones. The good news is that on various Android phones, you can use a mock GPS apk to fake your location. Though, Vivo  users need to be a bit cautious since the company has so many security restrictions. Don’t worry – I’m here to help you use the best mock GPS app for your phone. Read on to clear your doubts and enable the mock GPS provider on your phone like a pro!

![mock GPS on the map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Mock GPS on Vivo V30 Lite 5G?

As the name suggests, mock location simply means changing the present location of your device. A fake or mock GPS feature lets us select the present location of our device that would now act as its active location – instead of its actual one.

The good thing about Android phones is that they let us change the present location of our device, which helps us unlock various location-based restrictions. For instance, you can use a mock GPS app to catch more Pokemons, unlock a restricted content on Netflix, or access more profiles on dating apps like Tinder.

## Part 2: Any Precaution or Preparation for Mocking GPS on Vivo V30 Lite 5G

The mock GPS feature is not available in standard device settings. To access it, you first need to unlock Developer Options on your phone. This is because the mock GPS feature on Android is offered to developers to test the location of an app they are working on or any other need.

- Please note that when you use a mock GPS app or unlock Developer Options, it might change the overall functionality of your device.
- Some location-specific apps might not work properly or give you different results.
- It would also affect the running of your system and the core apps like Weather or Google will show different results.
- Therefore, it is recommended to mock GPS temporarily and stop it once your work is completed to avoid any long-term change in your device.
- A mock GPS app would consume more battery and memory on your device as well.
- Some apps would even become unavailable to you and you might not be able to install them from Google Play.

![mock GPS feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-2.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Find the Best Tool to Mock GPS on Vivo V30 Lite 5G?

If you look up on the Google Play Store, you will find a wide range of mock GPS apps readily available. Though, if you wish to mock GPS like a pro, then consider these things in mind while picking an app.

- **It is working/compatible?**

It might surprise you, but a lot of mock GPS apk files or apps that are available online don’t work. Carefully read the compatibility of the app and be sure that it would work with your Vivo  phone.

- **It is safe to use?**

Always make sure that the app would be from a trusted source. Ideally, I would recommend downloading a mock GPS app from the Play Store and not any unreliable third-party location.

- **Does it need rooting?**

Some mock GPS providers might ask you to root your device as well. Consider skipping these apps as you do not need to root your device to fake location or mock GPS on your phone.

- **Will it spy your location?**

There are even some spying apps that are disguising as a mock GPS app on Play Store. Therefore, you should make sure that the app would only change the location of your device and won’t spy on your location in the background.

- **It is pricey?**

Most of the mock GPS apps for Android are available for free as the service is not exclusive. Therefore, consider going with a trusted free app instead of buying a dedicated service.

- **Will it support your apps?**

If you are trying to fake location for a particular app, then make sure the mock GPS provider would support it. For instance, it should support the gaming, streaming, or dating app that you wish to change your location on.

- **What do other users think of it?**

Last, but most importantly, check the feedback and the real-life experience of other users of the mock GPS app. If it has a lot of negative feedback, then you can skip the app and pick any other option.

## Part 4: Step by Step Guide to Mock GPS on Vivo V30 Lite 5G

Now when you are all prepped-up, you can easily learn how to mock GPS on a Vivo  phone. As stated above, the fake or mock GPS feature is only enabled in Developer Options on the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device. Thus, you need to first turn on your Vivo ’s Developer Options and later pick a mock GPS app to fake the current location on your device. Here’s how you can fake location or mock GPS on your Vivo  phone:

Step 1: Enable Mock Location under Developer Options

To start with, you need to enable the Developer Options on your Vivo  phone. To do this, go to its Settings > About Phone > Software Info and tap on the “Build Number” feature 7 consecutive times. In some phone models, the Build Number is listed under Settings > About Device as well.

![Developer Options on your Vivo ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-4.jpg)

Once the Developer Options feature is enabled, go to your phone’s settings and visit it. Turn on the Developer Options feature (if it isn’t enabled) from here and allow the mock location field on the Vivo V30 Lite 5G device.

![mock location field](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-5.jpg)

Step 2: Install and Allow a Mock GPS App

Now, go to the Play Store app on your phone and look for a mock GPS app. I have tried and tested the Fake GPS Location app by Lexa. If you want, you can install the same freely available mock GPS app or try any other app as well.

![mock GPS app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-6.jpg)

After successfully installing the mock GPS apk on your Vivo , go back to its Settings > Developer Options > Mock Location app and select the fake GPS location app that you have recently downloaded. This will allow the mock GPS app to change the location of your device.

![change the location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-7.jpg)

Step 3: Fake location on your Vivo 

That’s it! Once you have granted the needed permission to the mock GPS app, you can easily use it to change the location of your device. Just launch the app to get a map-like interface. You can zoom in and out the map or just look for any location on the search bar. In the end, drop the pin on any location and tap on the start button to fake your location.

![confirm to fake your location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/mock-gps-on-samsung-8.jpg)

Later, you can go back to the app and stop the fake location to switch back to your original location whenever you want.

There you go! After reading this guide, you would be able to mock GPS on your Vivo  phone pretty easily. Apart from the Fake GPS Location by Lexa, there are tons of other reliable apps that you can use as well.

## Solution 2: Change location on Android phone by VPNs

Although all the VPNs claim to fake GPS on Android, only a few in the market can do it effectively.

And the best thing is you can download these effective VPNs from the Google Play store. Of course, there is no need to root your device.

**Note**: The internet speed will decline regardless of the VPN you choose. And if you want to fake GPS location on Android to play games, it is better to stick with the first discussed solution.

Here’s a quick overview of the three best VPNs to mock location on Android devices:

### 1\. SurfShark

SurfShark is the only VPN service with a built-in fake GPS location changer. Its virtual location IP address helps you reroute your traffic from anywhere globally and fake your actual location conveniently. It’s a premium tool and comes laden with tons of features (like protecting you online, blocking ads, and so on).

#### Pros

- Dedicated No Border mode to change your location with one-tap
- 3200+ servers across 65 countries allow you to change your IP location to anywhere in the world.
- Unlimited number of devices and cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android)

#### Cons

- Although it is one of the fastest VPNs in the market, the actual internet speed will decline
- Costly tool (US$ 2.30/mo)

### 2\. ExpressVPN

![how to fake location by expressvpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/expressvpn.jpg)

ExpressVPN ranks #1 when it comes to speed. Like SurfShark, it has 3000+ servers across 94 countries to reroute your internet traffic. However, you will have to use a fake GPS app alongside ExpressVPN to change your location on Android. Besides that one disadvantage, ExpressVPN does all that one necessitates from a VPN service. Each of its servers allows you to have a private DNS server and a wide range of protocols (something that SurfShark lacks).

#### Pros

- The fastest VPN service in the market
- It can spoof the HTML5 geolocation directly (helpful in changing location while browsing on the web)
- 3000+ servers across 94 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- It includes a plethora of features like IP address masking, access to restricted content, and so on.

#### Cons

- Although you can change your IP address and reroute your traffic from a virtual location, you will have to use a fake GPS app to spoof your location on Android.
- Above-average prices

### 3\. NordVPN

Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN does not include a built-in fake GPS tool, so it will become somewhat troublesome to manage two apps to fake GPS locations on Android (ExpressVPN and NordVPN). Nevertheless, if you don’t mind using a fake GPS app alongside, NordVPN should be your go-to tool if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck with VPNs in the market.

#### Pros

- Cross-platform support
- 5400+ servers across 75 countries to change your IP location to anywhere
- Ultra-powerful encryption and most outstanding performance compared to any VPN in the marker

#### Cons

- No built-in fake GPS location tool; you will have to use it alongside a fake GPS location Android app
- Its feature-rich interface will take time to understand and use on Android devices

You can conveniently use any of the three VPNs to spoof your location on Android devices. However, as indicated, only SurfShark has the built-in GPS tool. But the reason to recommend the other two is SurfShark, although a considerable VPN, falls short in terms of performance and features to NordVPN and ExpressVPN.

**The best VPNs in the market:** NordVPN and ExpressVPN will require you to use a fake GPS app on Android to work.

By combining a VPN and fake GPS app on Android, you will be able to access the sites that request your location before allowing you to view content.

Read on to find out about fake GPS apps and use them independently or alongside the best VPNs.

## Solution 3: Get a Fake/mock GPS location Apps

You can also use a dedicated fake GPS app on Android to change your GPS location.

### 2\. Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer

Here’s how to enable the developer option:

- Open

No. Most Fake GPS location apps aren’t detectable. However, if you are still unable to fake GPS location on Android using a third-party app, combine it with a VPN to also change your IP address.

Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location is the best tool to prevent online services from detecting your actual location.

### 3\. Can you Fake your location on Grindr?

Yes. Dr. Fone's Virtual Location program is the best tool to fake your location on Grindr. It allows you to unlock several profiles at any desired location and discover more people.

### 4\. Is it legal to fake GPS location on Android?

Yes, as long as you are not using them to engage in criminal activities.

## Wrap it Up

Once your fake GPS location is on Android successfully, you can stream restricted content on streaming services and mock your location on online services like dating apps, social media, and YouTube.

These three are the most effective methods to fake GPS locations on Android. However, only [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) doesn’t necessitate any complicated steps.

**The other two:** VPNs and Fake GPS apps on Android, are effective, but you will have to follow tons of steps every time you want to mock location on Android devices.
