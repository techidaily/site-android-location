## How to Fake GPS on Android without Mock Location For your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G

Almost all Android phones feature an application that allows third-party apps to track your exact GPS location. However, for some reason, users usually don’t like this feature because they don’t want apps to reveal their precise location. Sometimes, users want to stop sharing any location on apps, or you might want to access an unavailable app in your country. This is a common reason why most people want to fake their location. While there’s a mock location feature on most devices, you can also **fake GPS without mock location**. This simple guide teaches you exactly how to do that with different methods.

## Part 1: What Is the Mock Location?

Almost all Androids have the feature "Mock Location". This setting allows you to manually change the location of your device to anywhere you would like. Developers initially introduced this setting to test some parameters. However, people use it today to fake their actual location. If you want to use the mock location feature on your device, you must enable the "Developer" option. For example, when you utilize the mock location feature, you can fake your location in Venice while you’re in Detroit. There are many free fake location apps you can find in the Google Play Store to exploit this hidden mock location feature.

This mock location feature has many benefits when you use it to fake your location as below:

- First, it allows you to prevent any form of privacy breach.
- It enables you to access several third-party apps not accessible to your location.
- Finally, you can access location-based networking apps and interact with people beyond your locality.

## Bonus Tip: How to Change GPS on Android without Root?

Rooting devices have an increased susceptibility to malware attacks. Modifying the original software code raises the risk of introducing malicious software into the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device's system. Therefore, you may want to change the GPS location on Android without root access. Luckily, it can be achieved using certain apps that utilize the mock location feature. Here's a general method to change the GPS location on your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G without rooting:

- **2\. Access Developer Options:** Once Developer Options is enabled, go back to the main Settings menu, and you should see "Developer Options" listed. Tap on it.
- **3\. Enable Mock Locations:** In the Developer Options menu, look for the "Mock location app" or "Allow mock locations" option. Tap on it and select the app you want to use for spoofing the GPS location. If you haven't installed any specific app for this purpose, you can search for "Fake GPS" apps on the Google Play Store.
- **4\. Install a Fake GPS App:** Go to the Google Play Store and search for a reliable Fake GPS app that doesn't require root access. Some popular options include "Fake GPS Location" or "Fake GPS Joystick & Routes Go." Install the app of your choice.
- **5\. Set the Fake Location:** Open the Fake GPS app and grant it the necessary permissions when prompted. Use the app's interface to select a desired location on the map or enter specific coordinates to set as your new GPS location.
- **6\. Start Mocking the Location:** Once you have set the desired location, enable the mock location feature in the Fake GPS app. This will simulate the selected GPS location on your device.
- **7\. Test the New Location:** Open any location-based app or service that relies on GPS, such as a dating app or mapping app, to see if the new location is being used. The app should display the spoofed location instead of your actual GPS location.
